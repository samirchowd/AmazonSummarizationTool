0,074349279X,R2UHKBEME9WBDC,"Loved the story, disappointed in the ending",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2013",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"I really liked the synopsis of this book when I purchased it and couldn't wait to read it. And almost the entire way through, I did enjoy it. As the story went on, I began to like Amelia less and less and she was pushed towards being a little unrealistic. However, I felt that Matthew's character changed as well and not necessarily for the better. The argument, however, can be made that Amelia made him this way. Besides that, I enjoyed the characters and the story. But, I was supremely disappointed in the ending. I purchased this on my Kindle so I was keeping an eye on how much of the book I had left. Just when I thought everything was getting very good, I hit the 75% mark on my Kindle and the book was over!! The last 25% of it was acknowledgements and a sample of another Lisa Tucker book. I was so disappointed. There was so much more that could have happened and it just ended."
1,074349279X,R13NDJJ934OZ93,Does Lisa Tucker have a cure for the modern life?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2008",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Lisa Tucker's latest novel, THE CURE FOR MODERN LIFE, forces us to consider what it means to be a good person in today's social, political and spiritual climate.  Matthew, an executive of a pharmaceutical company, comes face to face with hard questions of morality when he meets, Danny, on a bridge one night.  Should he ignore the ten-year-old's cry for help?  Should he turn away from the small homeless and motherless (his mother is a drug addict) boy and his three-year-old sister on the cold Philadelphia night? Matthew agrees to let Danny and his sister, as well as Danny's mother stay with him in his Philadelphia loft.  Amelia, Matthew's ex and a medical ethicist, comes back into his life.  What happens next is a ""battle"" between Matthew, Amelia, and Danny's wants and desires.  The question remains is there a winner at the expense of the other two? Or is there a way to live with the compromise?  You'll have to read and find out."
2,074349279X,R3LQS37Q3DZTB,I loved it!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2014",,Verified Purchase,"I love Lisa Tucker, so I was excited to find this book.  It was one of my favorites from her.  I like the way her books are so visual and engrossing.  They can easily be converted into movies.  I love the way the book developed the characters, so they each had a unique personality. I love the karmic nature of this book.  The evolution of the character of Matthew was something I really related to.  I would definitely recommend this book to both men and women who love books that really dive into the nature of human relationships and suffering.  This book won't let you down!"
3,074349279X,R37HRBDORSJI3R,"Who are these people, and why do they matter?",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020",,,"I found this book on a shelf at home, and had no idea where it had come from. It's possibly a loaner from a family member or friend--but since I've been sheltering-in-place due to COVID-19, I'm reading voraciously these days, and decided to give it a spin. I'm a little sorry I read it all the way through, because from the start I found most of the characters lacking in dimension and credibility. The two children, Danny and Isabelle, are at least sympathetic; the adults, on the other hand, seem predictable and, at times, cliched. Character development takes a back seat to the overburdened and unlikely plot--Matthew, the vice president of a huge pharmaceutical company, takes in two nearly-homeless children because their addict mother is incapable of keeping them safe. He pays for a sitter to care for them in his edgy inner-city loft apartment when he's gone, which is frequently. He sends their mother to an expensive rehab program in Florida after Danny begs him to. Later he learns that the children's mother is dying of AIDS, and they will soon become wards of the court. Meanwhile, Matthew's former live-in girlfriend, Amelia, who is now married to Ben, his best friend from medical school, struggles to come to terms with her alternating feelings of love and hate for Matthew. Amelia becomes pregnant only to discover that Ben has never wanted to have children; his passion is--and will always be--science, research, saving lives. There seems to be a lot of sturm und drang in these characters' lives, emotional dishonesty and/or lack of genuine communication. Although there are hints throughout the story that Matthew and Amelia may ultimately reunite, the manner in which the stars realign so that Danny and Isabelle can become members of their new family together strains credulity. Ultimately, I found that I really didn't believe enough in any of the characters to care about their futures."

The premise is an old favorite, kids with a rough life find a benefactor.  Will they win his heart over?  This is normally a premise I find interesting, because it can be told in so many ways and take so many twists.  It seems always so simple at first, but it never is."
6,074349279X,R3FZYG5O2XZ882,A WOMAN WRITING FROM A MAN'S POINT OF VIEW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2012",,,"This is the first book I've ever read by Lisa Tucker.  I didn't know what to expect when I started reading it but I have to say I have never read a more engaging book especially where the male protagonist was written by and so convincingly voiced by a female author.  Matthew Connelly is the 40 year old central figure and Ms. Tucker's depiction of his ""maleness"" is so right on that I found myself crushing on Matthew.  He is highly intelligent, fun, funny, sarcastic, charming, disarming and caring.  He manipulates his friends with a genius void of emotion for their own good as well as his.  As Ms. Tucker has written Matthew he is inherently clever and witty and humor naturally oozes out of his pores in even the most bizarre situation.  Through no desire of his own he inherits 10 year old Danny and 3 year old Isabelle (both homeless) and despite Matthew's protests he almost immediately bonds with them and the reader realizes Matthew's bark is just that and his bite is nonexistent.  One also realizes that despite his griping and fit throwing Matthew is always there for anyone who needs him.  Always.  The only fly in the ointment is Matthew's ex-gf, Amelia, who is a spoiled, self-righteous, sanctimonious, wealthy trust-fund goody-two-shoes.  Amelia hates big corporations, especially pharmaceutical companies.  When she lived with Matthew, Amelia relentlessly mocked and berated Matthew's employer, a big pharma company.  She refused to have lunch with him at his place of employment because she didn't want to degrade herself.  She is also what men would call a ""fatal attraction"".  She devotes her entire life to persecuting and stalking her now ex-boyfriend, Matthew.  Even when she is pregnant by and living with another man she relentlessly harasses poor Matthew and it's obvious to the reader Amelia is still in love with Matthew which makes her persecution of him that much sicker and dare I say it, ""evil"".  Amelia is truly one of the sickest, ugliest female literary characters ever.  Matthew deserved so much better than her and the other loser women he seemed to date.  How did such a nice guy end up with such creepy women?  Perhaps he has a little ""savior complex.""  The Cure for Modern Life is an extremely well written novel.  There is a lot going on so one doesn't get bored.  When it starts to get a little bogged down in technical and pharma info it reintroduces the human element.  There's Matthew, Amelia, Ben, Danny, Isabelle, and the children's drug addict mother, Kim.  The story tells the truth about drug addiction but depicts the addicts humanity in a kind yet honest manner.  This book is now one of my favorites.  This is a funny, charming, heart warming, and even informative story.  I dare you to try and read it without crushing on Matthew.  Good luck with that!  :)"

10,052594480X,R1BFM1V4PCD5SH,I recommend this book to everyone I know,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2015",,Verified Purchase,"I found this book in my local library a year or so ago, never heard of it before, skimmed through it, decided it was worth a read, then started as soon as I got home & couldn't put it down, so I went on Amazon.com and ordered my own copy. I recommend this book to everyone I know. Poor Betty--losing her father & distant relatives in the Holocaust, surviving it herself, losing Richie, marrying Otto, starting a new life in America, then finding out that Otto had known since 1950 that Richie was alive & had been searching for her. Hollywood should definitely make a movie of Betty's story, it's that intriguing. I was glad to see that she had some ""closure"" and found happiness with Otto. Betty & her son, Robert both died in 2010 (he was in a car accident)."
11,052594480X,R34OS5J6BHXG1J,Life works in mysterious ways,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 1999",9 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"At its heart this book is about how one must make painful, uncertain decisions in painful, uncertain times -- and how one particular person and family lived with the impact of those decisions long after WWII had ended.  Reading about Betty's life, as well as her husband, Otto (not to mention  Richie), is a poignant, moving experience. All emerge as real people with  real virtues and real flaws -- products of the time and place in which they  were forced to grow up too quickly and in a world turned upside down. The  book works because of the well-crafted details: Betty's pre-war memories of  her mother's delicate tea cups and jam jars lined up neatly in a row; the  daily decisions her mother -- and others -- made during the war to protect  themselves or to escape the enemy; the description of how a friend, who  chose to pass as a gentile, was lost; and the pain in Otto's voice -- a man  who had resigned himself to always be second fiddle. No wonder he worked so  hard.  ""To See You Again"" reminds us that we're all too human,  that some choices stay with you forever, and that we can grow to accept and  even to embrace them."
12,052594480X,R2MXZNB9LF8D9U,To See You Again:  Purchased at Amazon.com,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2012",,Verified Purchase,"I can't get over this book, I read it in one day.  Never have I read a book like this, it just captivated me.  The authors mother was just fanatastic keeping her family together while being forced to walk to a concentration camp, and then making sure they survived the time in camp.  At first I felt bad when the author married a man she really didn't seem to love, but after seeing how she treated him during almost 30 years of marriage I felt rather angry at her.  On the other hand, how hard it must be to lose your first love and never know if he survived the war.  In the end I was very glad she stayed with her husband.  I think so many of the problems with the author and her husband was the fact that they never really dealt with living through the Holocaust and were both keeping big secrets from each other.  I'm so very glad I got to read this book."

Just like another reviewer wrote; ""is not Proust"" or anything similar but is great escapism. I read it all on a rainy afternoon and although I'm not in my teens, I could identified with the frustration Cathy's felt dealing with her evasive boyfriend, her know-it-all best friend and her (not at all) available mother. I just can't wait to read the sequel (is waiting patiently by my nightstand table)."

The characters seem real and alive--flawed people trying to do their best in difficult and unusual circumstances. And while they find that there's no cure for modern life, and obstacles keep sending you off-course from where you planned to go, sometimes, if you get lucky, you might end up where you belong anyway."

Admittedly, it's a page turner, you start off wondering where it's all going to go from here and I can't say I was ever bored and wanted to skip to the end... but maybe it's because it's such an implausible scenario that I just have a hard time saying ""you must read this book.""

I cried as Betty, upon being freed from the camp,  tried on clothes donated by Americans and twirled around feeling pretty again.  No one except perhaps Betty's mother in this book is perfect but they are admirable, beautiful people who overcame adversity of the worst kind to live good lives. The man she married selfishly did something that I would have probably considered unforgiveable if I'd been her.  Betty is a good role model for women and I wanted so much to tell her so but she died before I could do so.

Letting two homeless kids live in your apartment and then end up with custody of them after all that?

Sixty years can color a lot of memories, and since she allowed those memories to put her life on a self induced hold which kept her from moving on with her life, she comes across as quite self-centered and manipulative.  While growing up in Budapest prior to Hitler's invasion, she falls in love with Richie, another Hungarian Jew. Their love is, in her eyes, is of what fairy tales are made. Unfortunately she, her mother, brother, and sister are forced by the Nazis to become part of the death march from Budapest to Vienna. Richie is sent to a different work camp. That part of her story is heart wrenching, but she allows the telling of her love story with Richie to overshadow the horror of Mauthausen, the concentration camp from which she is eventually liberated. The obsession with finding Richie and then dwelling on how miserable she had been throughout her most of her adult life with Otto, her husband, overshadowed the memoir for me. For me she came to be an unreliable narrator of the love affair with Richie and her say in the concentration camp. It seemed to me that the camp should have been more devastating and  more of an obstacle to a happy, self fulfilled life than dreaming of a lost Richie especially when Otto treated her like a princess. After my book club discussed it, several of us wondered what her purpose was in writing the book in the first place."

Whether you love or hate the characters, agree or disagree with their action and choices, it is a very compelling book that keeps you interested and involved in the story to the last page, and a critical documentation of life during WWII for many of those who never had the opportunity to tell their own story.  This story needs to live on as a testament to the power of human will, the strength of human love, the power of faith,  and the depths of evil that humanity can succumb to, so that we can learn from the past those things that are necessary for human relationships and those things which no human should ever have to experience again.  Yet these horrors are repeated in corners of the world,  sometimes with and sometimes without our knowledge.  We must always remember that we all have a little evil in us, and yet as humans we will always have more in common with one another than ways in which we differ."

This  way I could spend the 35 minute commute to school in a more positive,  educational way. Sadly, I found my school library's audio book section very  limited, but I was determined to choose on. After searching one caught my  eye. ""To see you again,"" by Betty Schimmel. It seemed interesting  enough, something to keep my attention, so I got it, and popped it in the  second I started home. To my surprise the book captured me like none had  ever before. Betty's words were so realistic, so straight to the point and  didn't cover anything up with fairy dust. It was about life and everything  involved in it. It wasn't just about the Holocaust, or the war, or the  horrors surrounding it. It wasn't about her experiences in the camps or  losing her friends and family. It was about life and how complicated it  really is. I'd find myself in my driveway, waiting for the right time to  turn it off. I'd be in the car laughin so hard my cheeks hurt, or crying so  hard my face stung. Every day as the story went on, I would come home and  share my experience of Betty Schimmel with my mom who was captured by it  just as I was. We even sat and listen to the last 45 minutes of it  together. I will never forget Betty as long as I live. For her story of  life, as simple as we all wish it could be, is in us all."

Nook has continued to 'screw the pooch' with their readers ever since this one. I don't know what I'll do when these are all extinct. My only complaint, therefore the loss of one star, is the price.

Unfortunately I left my first one in the  seat pocket of an airplane. The second has developed spots on the screen where the light shines through as did the first one. The light breakthrough is annoying but I  can live with it because no other electronic reading device comes close to matching up with the Nook GlowLight.  The only reason I bought a new one is that I saw it on Amazon. I wanted to get one for my husband so I purchased two so we have an extra for ""just in case"".

I still like my Kindle better than the Nook, because the Kindle gives me the option to read horizontal or vertically.  The Nook does not offer this option.  The quality of reading is the same as the Kindle.  You can read the Nook in direct sun same as the Kindle.  The buttons on the sides of the Nook to turn pages are very stiff.  The swiping and tapping is another way to turn pages, but unlike the Kindle this requires 2 hands, one to hold the Nook and one to swipe or tap the screen.

Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white. It claims that you can go several weeks on a single charge (or was it months) I can't remember since it's been son long. There were times on my last deployments where we went almost a month without any electricity. After a successful deployment I can defiantly say that this nook proved it was up to the task. I don't think I charged it more than twice and the second charge was just because I had the time and means. The tablet was also very well built. As you may know, Iraq has lots of sand. There were even a few times where I dropped the tablet in the sand. The device kept on trucking and did not give up."

I tried using the Nook app for my Nexus 7 tablet but unlike the Kindle app, it was unwieldy and rather user-unfriendly. Not to mention needing the internet to actually READ the books I already bought. So I figured it was time to invest in another Nook--the Simple Touch.  No bells and whistles. Just a good, basic touchscreen e-reader with a very clear screen.  It's a fairly light little machine, weighs about the same as my Kindle. There are two aspects that makes Nook superior to Kindle: one is the expandable memory card slot. I've always liked the ability to add e-books from other vendors to my Nook. The second is the ability to customize screensavers.  Yes, it seems like such a minor thing, but I just like the personalization. I'm on Day Two of my new Nook and so far I like it."

I was also having issues with some books where I received an error when I tried to turn the page, almost like the page didn't exist. I would have to reset my nook, used the ""Go To"" function to skip to the page AFTER the one I wanted to read, and then go back a page just to pick up where I left off. And BN customer service is completely unhelpful when it comes to their slightly older e-readers, because everybody wants you to upgrade to their newest tablet editions with backlit screens. If I wanted to read books on a tablet, I would do that, but what I want is an e-ink ereader specifically for reading books. I have been a nook fan since the beginning and I still totally am.

It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it. Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations. I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an E-Ink screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine, but I did not played with it much."

There's the earth-mothers who think breast feeding is the be all and end all, whipping their boobs out proudly in public without flinching; then there's the mothers who seem to be in perfect shape, radiating confidence and glamor within three months of giving birth, making the rest of us feel wholly inadequate; and then there's our heroine - caught between the two.  This book has a good plot and will make you feel better about your mommy insecurities whilst having some laughs along the way.  A recommended read for all of us who know we fall short of the ideals - and don't care!!!"

The book surprised my with its depth - I was expecting something along the lines of the foolishness I have previously read in this genre. The ideas of friendship, adultery and self-esteem coupled with motherhood provided a very rich story that painted a realistic portrait of the struggles in a relationship post-child."

It's a blunt, funny story of a new mother caught in between the new world of diapers, spit-up, etc, her own insecurities about her life in general (she is unwed), and the transformation of herself as a result off all of these things. I loved this book. For anyone who is a mother, read it. It details the insecurities some women go through after having a child, along with the normal strains of a mother. But it also offers a refreshing and emotional outlook that anyone with children would understand about trying to understand yourself and accept the start of a new life and self. Can't recommend it enough."

From the moment she decides to search out Victor and learn his secrets, she is swept up into a mystery involving some shady characters and business. Not only does Cathy have to deal with this weirded out mystery she's gotten herself into, but there's her moody mom and her best friend who's having some problems of her own.

Her dad passed away unexpectedly and her mom is always working weird shifts at the hospital. She's not doing great in school, but she did meet a nice guy, Victor, a Chinese-American man who, okay, might be a little too old for Cathy. But things were fine until Victor dumped her, and she woke up with a weird mark on her arm. Since he won't talk to her, Cathy has launched an investigation. Suddenly she's in over her head in the part of Chinatown you don't visit as a tourist. Just in case, Cathy is putting together a book of her her thoughts and some (stolen) evidence. It's for Emma, her best friend, and if Cathy goes missing, she can only hope what she's found can lead to the parties responsible. This is a well-planned novel, complete with interactive web components, phone numbers to call, and evidence to inspect. While at times far-fetched, the characters are sympathetic and intriguing enough to keep the reader hooked through to the twist ending. Definitely a series worth continuing."

The pages not only describe  interesting events from the Eastern European campaign of World War 2, but  they contain a love story that operates on many different levels.  People  of the present generation may find the story in its totality hard to  fathom, believe or empathize with, but the days lived by the author were  during a different time when life was simultaneously cheap and valuable.  Betty Schimmel is an incredible woman, and if her husband, Otto, wasn't  Jewish, I think he could qualify for Sainthood.  Buy this book.

This story is one I will never forget; while the writing can be choppy at times the premise of Betty's story hooks you to the end.  Betty's love and memories of her first love sustained her through many of lifes events.  The fact that she was able to reconnect with him 30 years later is unbelievable.  This book I felt had an underlying message that war shatters lives.  Betty was fortunate to have those loving memories with her first love before the war and it is only natural for her to hold on to those when times were too difficult to take.  While I almost wanted to shake Otto at times for being so selfish I too understand his need to keep a family and the wife he has adored.  I hope that Richie Kovacs has found peace within his own life and has accepted his lose of Betty; again.  Really a sad, touching story.  I'm lending it out to many friends."

After having it for 3 days she had already read 4 books! She told me it was the best gift she'd ever gotten. I'm pretty sure she's already burned through that $40! The great news is that now when we go somewhere she doesn't have to choose which 2 books she wants to take. She has all of them in a smaller space than even one book!

It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.

I dinged the rating one star for two reasons: there is a lot of unnecessary gore here, some involving children and animals - I don't care for that; two, without giving away any of the plot, the ending is soft and unconvincing, given the amount of power the bad guys demonstrated throughout the book.

This slows the pace of the book.  On top of that, Horowitz' Dr. Watson, gives 21st century attitudes and commentary on the 19th century London.  Sir Arthur just told the story, without political correctness clogging up the tale.  Thus, although the story can be interesting, it takes to long to get going and doesn't  keep momentum.  I usually finish a book within a few hours, or a few days, depending on how well written or exciting the book is.  I've been reading this one for a couple of months, coming back to it between other books.  I haven't given up on it because I do love Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson adventures and there is enough in this book to pay homage to the Baker Street duo but I wish it was a more compelling read."

When a ""respectable"" character goes to prison, the character enjoys deference and respect that lower class criminal probably would not. But there are other instances where the perspective is oddly modern. To some degree, this is inevitable. There are incidents in Agatha Christie books that are cringingly racist, ans those works are far more recent than the original Sherlock Holmes stories. But I think the subject matter makes it worse."

This is a GREAT book! Not just an ok book, or even a good book, but really a GREAT, WONDERFUL book! I don’t believe in giving away the plot, or warning about “spoiler alert,” but I will say that the plot moves very quickly, & keeps your interest from the beginning. I suppose you have to be expecting a Sherlock Holmes mystery, as there is a certain style, which is unique (or, I should say, almost unique, because I think Mr. Horowitz has duplicated Sir Conan Doyal as much as could be done,) & if you don’t like that, the kind of language used, the historic setting, etc., then it may not be enjoyable for you. The House of Silk is intellectually challenging, in a way.  It’s got many unexpected  twists & turns. There is a dark side to it, which may upset some of a sensitive nature.

Stewart carries the taught narrative to the triumphant end. I didn't mind the product placement. I felt Stewart and the artists interwove the placements as gracefully as they could.

Although, it does seem boring in some areas, but over all it was very good. I actually like the whole idea of calling numbers and looking through the evidence, being a detective is fun!

Cathy an amazing artist like her father, yet weirdly drawing people older than what they already are makes her more interesting, she’s really crazy than what you will expect. Dead people here and there, mainly who kills them leaves us clueless.The authors ability to build tension and interest was great, I was amazed by how quickly things were done and how things quickly changed.

I’d rather chop my fingers one by one rather than reading the first 3 pages. The realism of the characters was okay, it wasn’t the best but it did not suck. He knew how to make the book vivid and realistic by involving real life crimes and things that occur in families. There wasn’t much characterization in the book but i don’t think it was enough, he did not use characterization effectively. The author’s ability to build suspense wasn’t the best, it was unbelieveable and terrible! He just made it more boring because nothing was ever suspenseful and or interesting.

I would recomend reading the evidence at the begging of the book and at the end but not all through it. You should enjoy the story.

This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though. The WiFi is locked into Barnes & Noble, only.  There is no ""period"", or ""dot"", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!). You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included. Also, you cannot make a purchase with B&N from outside the US, on this machine.

The feeling's akin to folding a magazine back on itself. And despite the shorter body, the screen is the same 6-inch Pearl e-Ink display as the Kindle 3, so the text is plenty big, sharp and contrasty. Also, the Nook is light.

There is nothing in either woman's life that  brings the reader to feel anything for them. Most of it centers on their love affairs and what losers they turn out to be. Boring.

Almost everything he touches turns to video. In Restless he's researched the BSC - Britain's 1940-41 effort to influence and tilt America towards war and support of England.

It is an espionage novel set in two distinct time periods:  World War II 1939 to 1941, and 1976.  It follows the exploits of its main character, a woman recruited to the British intelligence services during the the war, with alternating chapters focusing on her daughter in 1976, as she unravels the mysteries of the mother's life 35 years earlier.  The main characters are well developed, the pace is steady, the plot is plausible and there are some interesting surprises along the way.  Although the activity is with British intelligence, much of the action revolves around efforts to draw the US into the war, which adds an intriguing historical context to the story.  I recommend the book and will probably pursue other novels by Boyd."

Two stories are interwoven here.  The first concerns a prominent art dealer who fears he is being followed by an old enemy.  The second concerns the fate of one of Holmes street boys whom he calls ""The Baker Street Irregulars.""  There's plenty of excitement as Holmes and Watson unravel the puzzle.  Most important to me, though, was that Horowitz managed to channel Arthur Conan Doyle's writing style so completely that I was thoroughly satisfied.  The story line has some modern themes which Conan Doyle would not have dealt with, but Horowitz has handled that in part by having the tale told by an aged Watson.  I disagree with the reviewers who felt this Holmes was too weepy or troubled -- I feel that Holmes' reactions were not excessive and were in keeping with the serious events portrayed in the story.  I hope Horowitz publishes more Holmes stories."

I was disappointed that I figured-out the entire plot - and *all* the salient facts about the crime and the criminals - just by reading the story itself as I went along: one of the best parts of a Holmes story is getting to the end and having Holmes lay out the facts for you, and finding-out how much smarter Holmes is than you are yourself.  In this case I had worked out everything very early on, which was a bit of a disappointment.  But still, a very acceptable story all together, and worth reading if you are an avid Holmes fan like myself."

Adventure and action and plot twists that charm and bewilder the reader all at once. Horowitz created the great BBC series Foyle's War and now he's given us a Holmes tale to read, remember, and enjoy. American train bandits blow up a train inadvertently destroying a shipment of extremely valuable Constable paintings. Thanks to a reward put out by the collector and an English art dealer, most of the gang is destroyed in America but now the art dealer is frightened that the leader escaped and is tracking him down in England to exact vengeance. He calls in Holmes to protect him. Events seem to make this more of a familial matter than one of art appreciation and vengeance. Lestrade returns and is actually helpful to Holmes, sort of. A lovely action and opium and art filled tale that should appear near the top of the Zillion and one Non-Canonical Holmes adventures. I bought this item from Amazon--no one gave it to me, even though I have reviewed in scores of publications for over thirty years."

The movie was much better.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021",3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"“I Am Legend” is actually one of those extremely rare examples where the movie was a vast improvement from the book. In the movie, the protagonist is someone who is courageous, resilient, possessing great integrity, and generally someone you want to root for; in contrast, the book’s main hero is a hysterical drunkard who seems to be more concerned with his lack of sex life and not the fact that the world has come to a virtual end. Weird priorities if you ask me, concerning yourself with your urges and not your own survival. Quite a few times he actually ponders sticking it into a female vampire, technically a living corpse. Yes, it gets that gross. When he finally encounters a living female, his first response is not an empathic “poor thing, she has just lost her husband and children, I shall help her as much as I can,” but “she’s skinnier than I prefer them but I’d still do her… hopefully she’s not infected… I wonder why she’s so afraid of me though?” Yeah, I wonder too, you absolute brainless caveman. You have literally just chased her through the field when she clearly didn’t want to be anywhere near you; you slapped her and physically dragged her into your house and locked her in your bedroom. The insolence, not acknowledging you as her knight in shining armor indeed *heavy sarcasm here*. At this point, I was actually glad at how the book ended because the literary Robert Neville indeed would better off being dead than the movie one. The movie one I mourned; this one’s death I actually cheered. So yeah, if you watched the movie, don’t bother with the book. You’ll most likely end up being disappointed."

I'd seen all three movie adaptations and wanted to visit the source material. The closest adaptation was the Vincent Price. The other two are barely related to the original story. I'm a fan of Matheson's work and found out he had an unproduced script for the book that Hammer Films was supposed to make, but didn't. Well, I had to read it. Before I did I wanted to read the book. I Am Legend received some award as the Best Vampire Novel of the 20th Century. I would have easily given it to Interview With a Vampire. I Am Legend has influenced zombie movies way more than the vampire subgenre. Nonetheless, it is the definitive ""last man on Earth"" novel. It is far more about loneliness than vampires. There's only a couple of scary segments but there are many that reveal despair from solitude. A few things rubbed me the wrong way. Neville's constant attraction to the dead female vampires was weird. They want to eat you horn dog. Give it a rest. Also, there is a rather bloated chapter with a dog that could have done the same job by being a running thread throughout the novel. I'll leave my gripes there. No spoilers. Worth the read but always keep in mind, it was the pioneer of two subgenres and written in the late 50s."
289,1433203324,R2DZ8UJ3CXKIFE,A Classic With a Depressing Ending,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019",,Verified Purchase,"Writer Richard Matheson is a legend himself.  This tantalizing tale about the last man alive on Earth and his efforts to destroy a plague of vampires runs out of momentum about halfway through this superbly written novel. Chapter Five is sensational, but afterward the novel bogs down in our protagonist’s deconstruction of venerable vampire myths.  The cross is not a sure fire way to kill a vampire. The hero Robert Neville has lost not only his wife but also his daughter to an apocalyptic disease that wipes out mankind, and the survivors are vampires that besiege his house.  Neville has converted his home into a veritable fortress to keep out these fanged intruders.  One of closest friends—Ben Courtland—keeps haranguing him to come so a legion of vampires can finish him off.  Desperate but determined, our lonesome protagonist struggles to figure out a way to kill these predators.  Meantime, he goes to pieces slowly.  At one point, Neville tried to rescue the last dog alive, but he cannot help it.  Later,  he chases down a girl, but there is something about her to augers I’ll for him. In the end, Robert Neville reminds us just as Hemingway did in his own vintage novel “To Have and Have Not” that a man alone cannot make it.  Any time that a hero dies in a work of literature, it leaves a bitter taste in the readers mouth.  Nevertheless, Matheson’s prose is first rate.  His descriptions and dialogue are both memorable."

It is an excellent Ebook reader, I like the fact that it gives real page numbers (though at this point I am sure amazon's does as well).  But I also liked the fact that there are physical buttons in conjunction with a touch screen.  Overall, my reading experience with his device and Amazon is pretty much the same.  The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).

Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.  I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?

The only surprise I had, but then it explains why this model is a lot less expensive compared to the others is that this one is the first generation of Nook. It has only a few hundred Mb of internal memory and does not have back-lid screen to allow you to read  in the dark.

In a way I can understand why American readers may find this slow but do you seriously remember half the books that you read.  Ms Kelly always mangers to portray her characters in such detail that you can understand their actions.  We have a ull picture of the setting of the drama, and we don't always have a happy ending.  This is the whole meaning of a physiological drama it isn't a lunatic shooting off a gun but people that you can relate to caught up by their own one foolish mistake which changes their life forever."

Thankfully I read it while I was away on holiday so I was able to spend long periods of time with the characters of Louisa and Paul because when you start reading this book you will not want to stop! The story is told in the present day and also with flashbacks to the past of both characters-Louisa as a teenager falling obsessively in love with a wannabe rock star and the more recent problems of Paul and how he gets himself in trouble due to his friend Daniel.

It is about convincing Americans to join the War before Pearl Harbor and the efforts the British put into it. I many ways I thought it was somewhat far-fetched. It was an enjoyable read but it was complicated by the inclusion of the daughter of the heroine's life. I did not see the need for the story about the daughter and thought it detracted from the main story. I thought the spy happenings were well done and developed. I thought the book could have been better done if it developed more of the spy story than relying on on the daughter's life as a filler.

To cite just three of his novels, in addition to Restless, there is Any Human Heart, a chronicle spanning most of the 20th Century on four continents; an exciting and disturbing examination of chimpanzees and the scientist who study them, in Brazzaville Beach, set mostly in Africa; and The Blue Afternoon, in which Boyd  has crafted a compelling family mystery beginning in 1930s Los Angeles, moving to the turn of the last century in Manila, and concluding in Lisbon just prior to the second World War.  In Restless, Boyd returns to World War II, telling a thrilling story of a beautiful spy of Russian descent working for the British.  As she tells her story to her unsuspecting daughter some 30 years later, we learn of the sacrifices she and others made for their political and nationalistic goals, and the toll those choices took.  The novel has it all:  love, sex, cloak and dagger intrigue, shocking surprises, murder and betrayal."

I really enjoyed the book - the writing, the plot flow and the ending. The author transitions back and forth between past and present seamlessly, and creates an absorbing story that doesn't completely play out until the very end. The story of Eve Delectorskaya is interesting on its own, but its weaving with her current story and her daughter Ruth's life creates an interesting and absorbing tale. I especially liked the ending. So many novels fall apart at the end or don't necessarily tie all the loose ends together. I thought this might have the same kind of ending, since there were some things in Eve's story that didn't entirely make sense. But everything falls together at the end, both the confrontation with Romer and its aftermath, and the scholarly explanation (given by Ruth's potential love interest, a professor with an expertise in WW II espionage) of the confusing events that took place in New Mexico."

There are enough double-crosses and murders to keep fans of the genre satisfied and the ending brought things to a clean end, which is something you don't always get. One thing I found odd was a number of characters that ended up having no significant role in the plot.

But read on. The game is indeed afoot, and very mysterious it is, too, with ample twists and turns. Yet it circles back around to the initial story eventually, and ties it all together neatly. It receives four stars instead of five because it seems to possess a few (very minor) turns of phrase that seem just a bit too modern. The core plot, also, is I think influenced strongly by modern sensibilities. But, unless you are well-versed in the Canon you won't even notice these things. A worthy addition to the collection of Holmes pastiches that compares very well with others (I am fond of those by Nicholas Meyer myself). Bravo."

But the whole thing quickly goes off the rails, descending into violence and derring-do that seems quite out of place in a Holmes mystery. What is more, anyone who has read a book will quickly divine what the House of Silk is even before the clues start rolling in.  Who the various villains are is obvious almost from the moment they are introduced. You don't have to be Holmes to spot the revealing statements, or figure from the circumstances who is responsible for a particular crime. (In one case, it simply could not be anyone else, which sort of ruins the mystery.) I kept expecting to be proven wrong in some remarkable and entertaining way. Alas, the only reason to keep reading the story is to find out exactly why the villains are the villains. That revelation manages to be both tortured and ludicrous, even employing the ""Murder She Wrote"" deceit of revealing various clues at the denouement that the reader was not privy to until that moment."

I ordered the book last week that is supposed to have been a library copy.  Well when I received it I was shocked at how small it is.  I worked at a library for 11 years and had never seen a hardcover as small as this.  It reminds of a Readers Digest condensed copy.  So instead of adding it my collection I will be donating it my local friends of the library organization.  So if you are looking to read a great Sherlock Holmes novel I highly recommend this.

Nicholas Meyer's Seven Percent Solution stands out as a notable exception to a number of others who have tried and failed to capture the style of the original Holmes mysteries.  Horowitz has achieved an astonishingly perfect novel that Dr. Watson could not have written any better.  The atmosphere of Victorian London is wonderfully recreated as well as the pacing and authenticity of the dialog between Holmes and Watson.  If you had only a passing familiarity with the Holmes stories you would be hard pressed to distinguish House of Silk from the original tales.  If you have loved Conan-Doyle's accounts of the famous consulting detective I strongly recommend this novel to your reading list.

Some friends that know Sherlock much better than I do had mixed reviews. They had some issues regarding how Sherlock was portrayed and they felt it was not true to form. I thought it was a compelling storyline and being less of a Sherlock student meant I was blind to this.

I have read the Bible almost daily for over 40 years, and although I have memorized a lot of it, some parts have always eluded me with their archaic and symbolic wording and anachronistic references.  But reading this book has brought many of my favorite scripture passages into a new light and a new form of understanding.  Things that made only a glimmer of sense before are now very clear.  I thank Mr. Rubart for that... nice job!"

Every book seems to be lacking something to make it the top. This book gets a rousing 5 star review. Someone wrote if Peretti wrote the shack it would be this book. I love peretti and I really enjoyed the twists of the shack but this book is far better. Imagine, someone loves you enough to build you a mansion really, and knows you well enough that it suits you perfectly and has your memories in it, then imagine the person is long dead and you can't even remember him. He also seems to know your every thought and move. Hmm... what would you give up for that? Mysterious doors appear? Mysterious strangers? Odd unexplainable happenings. Oh yes, this book causes you to think of Gods love and what he wants to give us, if we'll only allow Him to take charge. I truly had a hard time putting it down and stayed up late too many nights reading it. Will look for more from this author but he has set the bar pretty high for himself! By the way, I forgot to mention it isn't a horror book. Thriller yes, suspenseful yes, but not scary or horror."

Sometimes while reading it I would think ""ok, would you get to the point?"" But by the time I ended the book I had a love relationship with it because the way the  author ended it, leaves you with no doubt about God's love for all of us. I'm not going to give anything away - but I will warn you.......BE PREPARED FOR A WILD RIDE! A ride that by the time you're done, you'll be happy that you took! But I'm sure you'll be thinking about this book  for some time. The author - James Rubart sure has an amazing imagination.....I can only wonder what his dreams must be like!"

Rubart, through his story of Micah Tayler, did a magnificent job showing the consequences of making life choices from a spiritual warfare standpoint. As people, we all make choices that take us down one path or another toward or away from heaven, God and eternity. Rubart's story of Micah Taylor brought the outcome of Micah's choices into clear view using Biblical teaching and scripture allowing the reader to see and feel the struggles Micah went through as he made decisions based on his own personal desires. Rubart's imagery was spectacular drawing the reader into the plot. Rooms is a story I won't soon forget. It's one of the best I have read using a fictional story to unveil the spiritual warfare that goes on daily for our lives. It helps the reader understand what could happen to them if they are careless with their choice."

But seeing it is a whole other thing, making Micah think he may keep the house instead of selling it, which had been his original plan.  Micah instantly fell in love with it upon seeing the gorgeous home on the beach, and didn’t want to go back to Seattle once he was there, but the plan Archie had in mind got him there and change was about to happen."

I wasn't expecting it to be a Christian supernatural book.  I'm not religious, but still found this book to be very compelling.  It was a strange ride and I enjoyed the interesting ways the author used to deal with past trauma's and how unconscious pain and conflicts can impact someone's life so profoundly.  For those that aren't that keen on Christian religion I think they can still enjoy this, since its focus is on the love and redemption qualities of modern Christianity, rather than dogma or the more controversial elements of the Bible itself."

It reminded me of Larry Crabbs’ book “Inside Out”. It helps you look into your subconscious and take a serious look into your “Self” side and Gods side and the issues they cost. In this case it cost the main character a dream situation. It also reminds me of the Bible verse about seek and you will find. The doors to the “Rooms” show me that that verse can work both ways. You can open a door to your self will or one to Gods will.

It's that good.  Ellis' obvious mastery of the idiom, coupled with a thorough understanding of the technology, assure that the most tech-savvy reader will feel right at home, along with the rest of us who just enjoy a stirring, involving read.  The character of Thunder is fascinating -- a man equally at home in the wilderness, in the halls of Washington, DC power, and in the hi-tech, high-stakes world of cutting-edge technology. After finishing the book -- and a sad moment that was (I was tempted to start all over again) -- I thought that two things were warranted: a sequel (soon please), and a major motion picture. I spent some time brainstorming ideal casting, with friends who had also read the book, but I'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you who got the nod. When all is said and done, you'll care about the characters and you'll worry about the probability of just such a scenario happening one day very soon. So run, don't walk, to get a copy of this fine book for yourself.  Soon you'll be singing the ""Song of Thunder""!"

Only one drawback for me, IT WOULDN'T END!!!  How many times do the hero's need to save the world? It started getting boring after the air force capt. destroyed the final (not final) missile, Then Cassy needed to do it all over again, then the whole marine one argument, then the Chinese need to try and save themselves, and ooops! our missile's that went to Russia were destroyed easily and quickly while the one's we sent flying OVER Russia into China caused yet more drama.

Keith Ellis drives Song of Thunder with a fresh approach and a writing style that manages to bring you into the story in a way that is rarely seen anymore. His main character is perfectly developed in a way that makes you feel that you know him as soon as Ellis presents him in the story.  The plot is firmly grounded in reality with characters that display the kind of courage and intelligence that actually leave you feeling GOOD by the end of the story. This is truly one of those books that you pick up and can't put down until you've devoured the whole thing. Do yourself a favor and get this book. You'll be able to tell people that you were in on the ground floor of a great new author and be greatly entertained in the meantime. Highly recommended and I can't wait for his next effort.

If you own or have read ""Quantum Ethics"" don't waste your money on ""Song of Thunder."" And vise versa. Come on Kindle - if it's not new, why sell it.

I have not seen the original Omega Man nor the Will Smith version of the films. I read this book using immersion reading while listening to the audiobook version. Robertson Dean's narration was prefect, matching the emotion of the text. The idea of a mutated gene is relevant considering the pathogens known and unknown. The ending was quite surprising at first, but then I remembered that a good deal of early science fiction tended to be somewhat depressing. I believe that's why I'm such a Star Wars, Marvel and Star Trek fan, their views are based on hope, not the constant dirge of apocalyptic nightmares so many authors and books write about. Definitely not one of my favorites. I would've loved to have seen the Punisher take the vamps out."

Learning about the struggle of one “uninflected” person left in the midst of the vampire apocalypse sounded so interesting. Even not knowing how different this book would be from the Movie adaptation of the same name, I wanted it to be intriguing. And it was in certain parts, but Robert was absolutely distasteful. His (or the author’s) racist and misogynist ideas seeped into every other aspect of the book. I wanted to sympathize with a person dealing with depression and addiction and loneliness and discovery but when Neville would reveal parts of himself in explaining the story I just hated him more and more. It just made me wish is Virginia or Kathy had lived rather than him, and much later that Ruth had instead been the main character."

It was way ahead of its time and Matheson inspired so many giants in the horror field, including Stephen King. This book in particular is one of the main contributing forces that gave rise to the zombie genre. I wouldn't say this is a literary masterpiece so much as an amazing story that is solidly written. The premise is dazzling and it kept me turning the pages. I will refrain from giving it the fifth star because some of Neville's thinking got a touch repetitive for me and I was actually a little confused about what constituted a (WARNING, mild spoiler) vampire or another kind of undead type of vampire being that isn't quite a vampire. I honestly can't spoil it too bad because I don't clearly understand that part."

The protagonist readily expresses contempt for the vampires while repeatedly seeking to suppress his deep desire for the wanton female vampires which is no more than a poor and obvious metaphors for racist white men’s objectification of black women and fear and dehumanization of black men. Take the time period the book was written in and a few more obvious clues early on and it’s clear this ‘vampire story’ is just a racist metaphor. We will be invaded by vampires (minorities) until our society decays to nothing

The movie was good, but I found the book to be even better. The primary characterization is spot-on, especially the in depth dive into alcoholism, which I can personally attest speaks to the truth of the disease. Making our hero somewhat of an as* is likewise genius, and when the reader experiences a bit of revulsion towards this main dude and his borderline misogyny, it's not bad writing, but good."

Overall, it’s a pretty good story.  However, it does suffer from a dated “70’s style” of writing.  For instance, the author assumes the reader doesn’t know about “mutant genes” and the activities of bacteria and viruses...which are all pretty common knowledge, nowadays.  Also, I’ve seen this with other authors from the 70’s...they seem to have an almost romantic fascination with smoking...and weird heavy drinking."

Not this one. This book follows Robert Neville as he lives day to day with little to know hope in probably the most accurate form of life with depression I've seen written in a book (I have a depression and a lot of the storytelling hits very close to home.) There is dread and horror and an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness that pervades the entirety of this book. My only regret is not buying this book to read sooner.

That tiny book, about turning your heart into various rooms of a home and inviting Christ into each one to do a thorough cleaning, seems to be the premise for Rubart’s book “Rooms: a novel”.  The main character has had severe trauma as a child and consequently walked away from God and family in lieu of a life he could fully control that is centered around work. One day at the office he receives an official notice that a deceased uncle, seemingly unknown to him, has bequeathed him an extremely valuable, beachfront home. After one weekend visit to supposedly set up the sale of this place, our protagonist is off on an adventure of discovery and forgiveness that will reunite with his father and his FATHER. A bit difficult to catch on to the shifting times, places and POV’s but you’ll find it uplifting and worth the effort."

There is rich, visual detail.  There is the clear battle between Heaven and Hell for a man's heart without it being corny. It emphasizes the importance of relationship with Christ over religious acts. It is full of direct Bible quotes. It has romance but it's not disgusting, soft porn or even the main story. I usually eschew any and all Christian books with romance but this was different. It addresses emotional pain in a way that makes you feel it with the character. The inherited house is such a point of great fascination, handled with incredible detail. I started this story slow but at chapter 3, I couldn't stop reading. After I started, I had the book finished in less than 24 hours.  I recommend this for the Christian reader who needs a little more supernatural than most Christian books seem to be offering. My only regret with this book is the fact that it's over."

He has found a life that appears rich and blessed but is in fact empty. This is a familiar theme to anyone who reads books that tell the stories of people who seem to have it all but inexplicably find their lives are empty. The challenge is to tell the story in a unique and surprising way. And that is exactly what Rubart does. It is a special gift to take what is a formulaic approach to a story and give it the twists and turns that keep it interesting and unique. This was a great read and I recommend it enthusiastically. Enjoy.

However, though his uncle has given him a mansion, he is also leading Micah on a path to face his past--the good and the bad, so that Micah can reconnect with a God whose voice is now a distant part of Micah's life. This novel is about the battle for a soul and only if Micah Taylor relinquishes his worldly life, as well as faces a past that he would prefer to not remember, not only will he allow God to truly have his heart but Micah Taylor will also be free."

I don't want to give any spoilers away, so I have to keep my comments vague, but my big peeve was that the characters seemed very flat compared to the original stories, including some reactions to different situations that didn't seem in character at all to me. There was absolutely no purpose to an entire chapter where Watson encounters a famous name, except to have an appearance by that famous name in the book and that irked me. If you're looking for a good Sherlock Holmes Pastiche, read Laurie R King's 'Beekeeper's Apprentice' series or Lyndsay Faye's 'Dust and Shadow'."

In a nutshell, this is a story of unequal love and unequal friendship and their fatal consequences - played out in the late 1980s and the present in London, the Thames Estuary, and a historic garden near Leamington Spa. The sense of time and place are accurate, nostalgic and compelling; it's become a bit of a trademark forte for this author. The pace is slow enough to let the book breathe and fast enough to ensure that you will continue reading until the bitter end. This is really far too fun to be classed 'literaray' (thank God), but actually - it's pretty classy stuff. Kelly has been compared to de Maurier, which is unfair - she's much better. And if she's good enough for Stephen King for chrissakes (""I wish I'd written it"") - she's good enough for the rest of us. A great read. Highly recommended."

She not only goes backwards and forwards into Paul's life she also does it to Louisa's life so it gets a bit comlicated at times. It begins in 2009 but goes back to 1989 and eventually you end up in 2010.  Still a good story and unusual.  I would recommend it.

No complaints about it at all. I'd been wanting to read the book since seeing ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""I am Legend"" (which definitely wasn't as good as the former, of the book). The book is better than either movie (I can't speak to ""The Omega Man"" because I've never seen it). One thing I will point out is that if you are buying the mass market paperback version, please note that the book actually contains ""I am Legend"" as well as many other short stories. I was a little thrown off when reading the book, and about in the physical middle of the book the story ended and short stories picked up. Yea, there was a table of contents that I paid no mind to, because nothing on the book cover or in the book mentioned that it contained other short stories. I was a little disappointed thinking that I still had half a book left, only to realize I was at the end. Technically, all the extra short stories are bonuses, if you like horror short stories."

The biggest being that it is an original take on the vampire, which blew me away. I had no idea that vampires were the antagonist, or of the era in which it takes place. It's not a very long story either and if I'd been able to read each night I probably would've finished it easily in a couple days. I was literally at the 50% point just two days ago and that second half was riveting. This was a great read and one I'd recommend to anyone interested in a classic."

Its a lot more than just bloody gore and jumpy scares. Its also about survival, and the struggles of man with his inner demons and loneliness. Themes that go a bit deeper than your average zombie apocalypse movie. For that I actually really liked it, though it did start out pretty slow but once I got past the first few chapters it quickly became a page turner for me. Like many others I first heard about this book through the movies, for me it was I Am Legend with Will Smith. In my opinion if you haven't seen the movies yet, or already have, then you should read the book as well. None of the movie adaptions have the same weight as the book does."

Its kinda cheesy but I really like the main character and the world the author builds around them. The meaning of the story that I found was satisfying. When I finished I Am Legend I was kinda disappointed however that the story didn't keep going and instead so far it seems like its just short stories. I mean they are fine but I mainly want to read more I Am Legend not short stories. I wont take off a star for it however but it is something to note.

Robert Neville is alone. Very alone. Well, not completely alone. His family, friends, and neighbors have all come down with a bad case of vampirism.

Right now I want to alert everyone not to buy your Simple  Touch from Amazon.  While I love Amazon, I thought I would use my gift cards to purchase my Nook from them rather than going directly to Barnes & Noble.  Was directed to several dealers and selected Ricks Collectibles who had a great rating.  My Nook came quickly and everything seemed OK until I tried to purchase the extended coverage.  Apparently my Nook had been purchased in November at Sears, resold and somehow ended up at Ricks.  Although I purchased it Jan. 3, 30 days had elapsed from the date it was originally purchased it November and I couldn't purchase the service contract.  PLUS, my 1 year warranty actually started in November, so I got gyped there too.  I never realized I was going to run into this trouble when I purchased my Nook and the only reason I bought it this way was to use up my Amazon gift cards.

Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony."

One drawback is that, for PDFs, there is no option of looking up for using dictionary. The back light is very good and i am able to read for hours without any strain.

A new home that was built just for him with specific instructions from the long dead relative. A house with rooms that appear out of nowhere, with the contents forcing him to face his past, his demons, his religious beliefs, and his future. Needless to say, the suddenly appearing rooms in his house that force him to confront issues are synonymous with the parts of his heart and head that have the same issues. The story itself is so-so, but the message contained therein has had me re-evaluating certain aspects of my own life that have long troubled me or that I’ve flat-out ignored.

While I understand that most authors who are trying to make a specific argument often state the claim over and over, they also usually offer different examples or evidence to support that claim.  Derr restates the same claim and evidence in just about every chapter.  Also, he moves between periods and geographies without organization. Just when I thought he was moving forward in time, with foragers to farmers, he jumped back to foragers again.  Or, just when I thought I was along for the ride as humans were crossing the Berring Strait, he leapt back to the Middle East or Eastern Europe.  This disorganized book left me thinking that maybe there just isn't enough evidence to support a solid theory on how dogs became dogs."

Commissioned by the family of Sir Arthur, he captured quite wonderfully the essence of the time period, the people who lived in it and most importantly Watson's style of narration, although this tale is much darker than any before it.

I did so only because a book group was reading it this month.  I am not a fan of dystopian fiction so the first 10 percent or so was good but not great. Man alone hiding from infected former humans during the night foraging during the day.  But the conflict soon develops not just between the narrator, Robert Neville, and the vampire infected around him, but Robert's internal struggle.  First Robert is struggling within himself to remain sane, to accept the fact that he is alone. Robert's desire for human companionship and memories of his wife and daughter are eating at him almost driving him insane.  Then it becomes a battle against the ""disease"" of the infected. He reads and studies about viruses and bacteria.  He studies the blood under a microscope trying to find the cause and the cure of the infection.  Along the way he finds ""almost"" companions but the emphasis is not so much on the companionship but on looking for a cure for the infected.  Robert Neville is a fascinating character as he struggles with his environment, society, and himself."

I heard things like, ""it's nothing like the book"", ""the ending sucks"" and ""it misses the point"".  Now I know why.  Let me just tell you, the movie does miss the point, particularly with the theatrical ending.  That version of the film misses the point like the missing the broad side of a barn  with a tactical nuke at point-blank range.  That's not to say I dislike the movie.  I thought that, with the alternate ending, it was pretty good.  I still think that.  However, reading the original story has changed my feelings about it a bit, namely that I like certain things about it less than the novel.  Now, I don't remember if the credits say ""based on I Am Legend by Richard Matheson"", but if they do, I believe they definitely commit the crime of false advertising.

Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android! There are limitations, of course. Rooting the Nook (via Nooter), while not difficult, does require some level of computer know-how. The Simple Touch does not have any sort of audio output, and the e-ink screen can't handle video.

Okay, things appearing that weren't there before - do we ever notice something later on that was there all along?  God shows up but we don't always notice Him.  Our bad!

The first universe we encounter stars Micah Taylor as a Satan driven entrepreneur who loves the thrill of risk taking to get money and power. In the other universe we see Micah appearing as his God fearing self, seeking the transforming healing and freedoms of Christ. His deceased Uncle Archie has left him revealing letters saying""If what you do brings freedom and life-it is most likely Christianity.If it doesn't it is probably religion and there's already too much of that in the world."" He tells Micah that the Lord is about liberty,which states the theme of the book. Many dreams and spiritual encounters are brought about in the different rooms of the house his Uncle had built for him, hence the title""Rooms"".Rubart uses vivid, picturesque imagery of the Northwest and imaginative metaphors,so classic in his works, to make them enjoyable. So if you want to read a fast paced mystery full of a compelling sense of immediacy and sound Biblical truths with a touch of romance thrown in,Rooms is the book for you."

Although he plans to sell the beach house, Micah spends some time there and begins having very strange experiences, including the discovery of new rooms that weren't there before, an unfinished painting that becomes more complete each time he sees it and a stack of letters written to him years ago by his uncle. When Micah returns to Seattle, things get even stranger as he runs into people who don't remember meeting him and his apartment changes floors.

Micah becomes the owner of a beautiful, one-of-a-kind house and learns various life and spiritual lessons in each of the special rooms. Throughout this book, there was a tug-of-war between good and evil to get Micah to make certain choices which would send him down incredibly different paths. This was a spiritual journey that involved second chances and forgiveness. Through letters from a dead uncle,Micah received guidance and encouragement to complete his journey. As Micah made various life choices, the realities in his life changed, often dramatically. The interactions and conversations with spiritual beings were powerful and packed an emotional punch. Beautiful, descriptive writing was thought provoking and gripping at times. A rewarding romance was woven into the main storyline. A satisfying and enjoyable read...I loved it!"

That is a bit ironic since the story is a about a mansion that the protagonist inherits. This book had plenty of things for me to relate to, which is one reason why I found it so enjoyable.  There was no trace of Papa Jemima (a little Shack pancake humor), but there was plenty of action revolving around father - both earthly and Heavenly. Micah Taylor is not extremely fond of either of them at the outset. Piece by piece the puzzle as to why he loathes even calling his biological father on the phone are revealed to the reader. You might call it a mini-mystery.  That's only one of the themes of the book. The main course deals with Taylor's heavenly father. Rubart does a great job of stringing the readers along, giving them enough of a bread-crumb trail to figure out the majority of the background for the anguish that torments Micah despite his impressive success in the business world. And the primary antagonist turns out to be Micah himself. This inner conflict is depicted through the sights and sounds of the various rooms that spring into existence in the mysterious mansion his great-uncle had custom built for him."

The first chapter was beautiful and made me cry and the second chapter was breathtaking, but the rest of the book was almost as dull as dishwater. The author seems to have come from the ""Tell, don't show"" school of writing.  As for the characters, they are passive and self-centered. Also, for people who are constantly thinking about this or that, they seem awfully dense.  For example, one of the main characters cheats on her husband (twice) and then tells him a whopping lie and then refuses to have sex with him.

It sounded like the sort of book I could get lost in. The reviewer gushed with praise. I really looked forward to it. I read and read and about half way in, I started skipping ahead, thinking let's get on with it. There were pages and pages about who the characters were and how they were feeling and how it was that they were feeling what they were feeling. In my mind, the characters should be doing and saying and thereby letting me know who they are, instead of the author telling me. My preference in books are those that are character driven, not plot driven, so it's not that I need constant action. I just want the characters to speak for themselves. Near the end of the book, one of the characters asked a question and it was four pages before the other character replied. In between, the author had to explain it all to me. That's a copout. By the end of the book, I knew the characters outside in, not inside out."

Sherlock Holmes is determined to find out, with the help of the now-married Dr. John Watson.  Horowitz's Watson is writing in retrospect, years after the case has been closed, for its nature was so horrid that the tale could not be told at that time.  The dust jacket notes describe the case as `too shocking, too monstrous, ever to appear in print . . . until now.'  While that is a bit hyperbolic, there is enough evil to go around and even (mini-SPOILER) a cameo appearance by our favorite mathematician and chemist, Professor James Moriarty, as well as an appearance by Holmes's obese brother, Mycroft."

Due to the nature of the investigation, Holmes brings his brother, Mycroft, into the case. Poor Watson, did not even know of the existence of Mycroft. After watching many of the PBS programs, I can imagine this book as a presentation. The Sherlock Holmes novels are interesting in the detective work and the development of theories."

The interwar period between WWI and WWII has always been fertile ground for noir writers and it is where Mr. Boyd enjoys a sweet spot."

I was hoping it was more than that, but in the end that's all it was.  Clever premise for the ending, but unsatisfying.  Because the ending revealed the author's kernel of thought, as clever as it was, and in going so made the whole book a gothic travail.  Which I'm tired of, middle aged in the year 2020: it's too easy and trite, and real life has enough gothic content to make reading more depressing and unrewarding."

I first read it when I was twelve, and I've reread it many times and enjoyed it every time. Yes, some of this enjoyment is nostalgia, but it is true sci-fi horror and very well done.  The vampires are the result of a plague, and there is nothing romantic about them.  They want Robert Neville's blood.  He manages to keep them at bay, tries to adapt to a new existence without going bonkers, and suffers from loneliness and angst because he believes he is the last original human alive, at least in his corner of the world.  It has a real twist for an ending.  It's a quick read, but well worth your time, and truer to the spirit of what vampires are really all about: day sleeping blood-suckers!  Come on!"

It's even more infrequent that I read a book that wasn't written in the last 2 years.  I Am Legend was first published in 1954...  So why did I pick it up?

After reading the book, now I see why people got so annoyed at the movie.  They are COMPLETELY different.  Though, I'm not one to get too upset by such things myself,  I do get why other people might have been upset by the liberties the movie took.  Anyways, that being said, I liked this book.  I didn't think I was going to at first though.  In my opinion, this book took a very long time to get moving with any substantial plot or action.  I appreciate that they wanted to set the tone and the mood of the world for the reader, but if I remember correctly, it's like 9 chapters into the book before the word Vampire is even mentioned.  I almost gave up several times.  The only reason I stuck with it was that for years I'd heard how good the book was from various people.  Luckily, once the book gets rolling it's quite entertaining, and pretty much maintains that pace throughout.  With the exception of a few out dated (and potentially offensive, if you are sensitive)  references to African Americans, this book reads well for a novel written over 30 years ago.  Lots of action and lots of interesting characters.  Certainly ended up being worth the read."

I enjoyed the film with Will Smith, but it was totally different than the book.  To me, the film was more about the triumph of the human spirit; one man fighting for humanity.  The book is more of a philosophical examination of what it means to be normal - part of the majority.  Matheson chose vampirism to be his plague, but really, he could have chosen anything.  The question becomes, is a person still normal when the rest of the world is different, is it right to keep fighting against change?"

I won't give any spoilers but I can't see a person showing up and the adults not checking with that child's parents about the circumstances that brought that child to your door. Some of the sexual details could have been more tactful. I think the impact of grief on the intimate lives of those involved is worth exploring, so I'm glad it's discussed, but the author could've done that without giving so much detail. Overall, It an interesting read...not enough to make me want to read it again though."

But the demise of the Ryrie family baby - an event that serves as prologue and organizing theme - is recounted in such a dispassionate manner that I was unable to engage.  The emphasis on descriptive metaphors is particularly off-putting, sort of like looking at a painting and wondering at the brand of brush used, or listening to music and envisioning only notes on a page.  Analytical and disconnected."

Mother and father Ricky and John are trying to desperately maintain normalcy in their family, despite the fact that their marriage is falling apart and neither one of them has figured out how to deal with their grief. Their older child, thirteen-year-old Paul, is an outcast at his school and dealing with his own grief in some interesting ways. Their younger daughter, Biscuit, is confused about why her baby brother never came home from the hospital and begins acting out to display her confusion and anger. When an unexpected family member arrives at their front door, the Ryrie family must come together and try to understand what one another is feeling, as their family dynamic is unraveling rather quickly."

It has no physical properties, but it fills a room, a life, many lives, and creates pain. It's bigger than a boulder, but is amorphous. You can't domesticate or quarantine grief, but it can isolate, alienate, afflict. The sun rises and sets, our shadows shorten and lengthen, but grief reaches into darkness and obscures the light. Its stride is long and its span is spacious, but it has no measure. Grief is timeless, but time heals, according to the maxim."

Of course, our choices in life can and do affect the future, but if you could go back and revisit how and why you made that choice and the underlying reasons for how you chose to live, then this book is for you.  Also, who are you really listening to when you hear the inner voice of reason, even though it may be telling you exactly what you want to hear.  Recognizing the voice of God is critical in our decision making and this book will definitely give insight on this subject.

I thought this was going to be a scary, suspenseful story about a ""haunted"" house, but much to my temporary disappointment, this book is quite different.  Once I realized this book was going to be different than I thought, I opened my mind and let my imagination go wild and quickly found myself engrossed in this story.  Micah is just a regular person like all of us who has to make difficult decisions like the rest of us.  We all face the same battles that Micah faces, which is why this story is so engrossing - and so relevant.  Some of the spiritual and religious parts felt a little heavy, but the author balanced them very well with lighter moments of Micah spending time with Rick or with Sarah or simply enjoying his house."

There is a lot of information in this book, much of it firmly backed up with the latest scientific research, but I have to agree with the reviewers who questioned the editing: the book is poorly organized and the same facts, anecdotes, and theories appear over and over again.

Mark Derr certainly gathered many resources and on first glance presents his points technically. However, after finding many glaringly wrong or suspiciously twisted statements, the book simply didn't deserve the time to read it past chapter 13. The author appears to have formed his opinions and insights on his own experiences, some anecdotes, and his own scientific readings, but not education. From the start, he tries to redefine words which already have a scientifically accepted meaning, such as ""tame"" and ""domestic"", then jumbles his new definitions around so many times that the reader no longer knows what he is referring to. His understanding of genetics is less than that of a high school graduate..it's almost embarrassing! He obviously has no real-world experience in captive breeding of wild animals and makes the typical assumptions of the inexperienced when he discusses it. He occasionally does make insightful comments, but they seem almost accidental."

It seemed like something right up my alley as someone with interest in evolutionary genetics. I thought the book would start out by describing exactly what makes a dog a dog. He could have gone into the breeds, talking about the differences in dog size and lineage, describing how that isn't true speciation. Perhaps he could slowly work his way backward from what we 'know' about where the breakoff point for the breeds descended from, and maybe give us a half dozen starting points. Then from there, he could move into the less known. How did dogs serve in ancient cultures, what were the triggers for change, why did those changes occur? Finally, he could move back to wolves, and give us an account of dog wolves, and the conjecture. He COULD have done something like this. He didn't."

These critics use a vague complaint in lieu of critical argument. Expect a lot of resistance to Derr's thesis due to the current state of political correctness in dogdom which is trying to write the wolf out of the domestic dog's makeup, most especially to counteract the media phenomenon of Cesar Milan. (Ironically several years ago Mark Derr wrote an Op Ed piece in the NY Times entitled: ""Pack of Lies"" rebutting Milan's approach.) This is straight science by an accomplished scientific journalist and if you're willing to consider a fuller as well as the latest findings on how the dog became the dog, this book should sit right next to Coppinger's ""Dogs"" in your library.

And the reason is that Holmes power of observation and deduction is always front and center, and well recounted by Watson.

It's pretty damn influential, particularly in films as it was a primary inspiration for 'Night of the Living Dead'. (And, it was adapted for film twice, first as 'The Last Man on Earth', then as 'The Omega Man' (which it resembles in only the vaguest manner.)  But adaptations are quite entertaining I think, if far from truly satisfactory.)  Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite novels, horror or otherwise.

The mystery, as Neville tries to find a reason for the plague, was compelling even as you're getting the idea that he's been alone too long and is most likely crazy.  Parts of it were also incredibly sad as he tries to cope with being alone.  With all of that combined, I just couldn't put this book down."

A man named Robert Neville is the last man alive on Earth. Everyone else have become vampires and this story is about Robert's life being alone in a world full of hideous beings. It is a very simple and basic premise and yet Richard Matheson has taken it and spun a really deep and complex tale out of it.

Unlike others my Kindle eBook contained no other stories but the title story (purchased Feb, 2013). I did  not mind the descriptions, the story held me and the descriptions help me understand what the man was going through. Since most of the story only has the one character I don't see how it could have been otherwise. Keep in mind this was written in 1954. I compare the story line to the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks. It is the story of a man alone in the world trying to survive a plague that turns everyone else (as far as he can tell) into zombie like creatures. I enjoyed it.  A short read.  You understand what he is going through, the stress, his breakdowns, his escape through booze, his series of spirit shattering disappointments.  I don't want to give anything away by giving more details.  Suffice to say that the latest movie (based in a large city) is very loosely based on this story which is in a suburb of a small town. I understand the Will Smith movie was the 3rd based on this story."

I read Hell House years ago and it was one of my favorite horror novels, so I've wanted to read I Am Legend for a long time.  I read it before the movie came out, but the movie was so different that it really didn't matter.  The book was written in the early 1950's and I think it was pretty innovative for that time.  Apparently it was first marketed as sci-fi, and only later became known as a horror classic."

I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this book. I cannot understand the negative reviews this book received. You have to be some kind of desensitized child not to appreciate the amazing development and emotions of the characters and themes of this book. And though it does not focus on action and Gore this book truly does belong to the genera of horror. If you can read this book and take on the emotions as your own then you will find a terror just as thrilling and far deeper than that of your contemporary horror novels. Yes the book is short but I did not feel the ending was rushed or let me down. And one must remember this was written as a futuristic piece back in the fifties. If you're looking for a book about the movie don't bother, this came way before and the movie was only loosely based on it. However I loved the movie too. If you love the horror genera and have a good mind there is no way you should skip this book. It's a must read for horror/vampire lovers. 5*"

I read a review of it in the Wall Street Journal, and it sounded like it was just up my alley. As a dog lover, it is fascinating to me to think that my Shiba, and every other dog, from tiny Chihuahuas to St. Bernards, from pugs to greyhounds, all descend from wolves. And they can all interbreed. How is that possible? The time spans that I have seen just seem too short for such variety in evolution. Could we ""breed"" humans into giants and midgets and people with six-inch noses? What exactly is the process involved, how do scientists think this happened, and when and where did each breed get created? When you read, for instance, that dachshunds were breed to follow prey in tunnels, what exactly does that mean? You couldn't just decide you needed a dog with short legs and make it. It must have taken a very long time. Were they purposefully bred?"

Ricky and John Ryrie's newborn son dies just days after birth, as a result of a serious birth defect. While this situation in itself would be painful enough to deal with, for the Ryries the situation is made worse by the fact, Ricky knew her risk was high for having an infant that might not survive, yet she chose to keep the info to herself, just in case the tests, indicating the possibility of a rare brain deformity, were wrong. She ignores the radiologist's statement that most couples in this situation would opt for an abortion -- for Ricky this was never an option."

I recommend The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes to anyone who has never read this material.  Much like wading into the ocean (instead of running and diving), the Adventures offer small samplings of Conan Doyle's work without intimidating the reader. Considering how well-deservedly famous they are,  I do not intend to insinuate that these stories are lesser than the novels but that they offer a simpler and quicker tasting of the material.  The Adventures are well-written but in smaller form and easier to digest.  The stories are indeed mysteries but their subject matter and length do not lend themselves to a long denouement or extensive flashback as in A Study In Scarlet or The Sign Of The Four. Sampling these shorter works might encourage a new reader to venture further into the canon and educate his or her literary palate."

I bought this Kindle edition because it had Whispersync to the audiobook edition. I, like most people in the English-speaking world, had heard of Sherlock Holmes but had never read any of the stories or books until now. I love the style of writing, the vocabulary that Arthur Conan Doyle uses and the vivid descriptions he illustrates with his writing. Sherlock Holmes is the epitome of genius when it comes to investigating and deducing facts, but the way he arrives at his solutions is so intriguing. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Holmes and Watson and the equally intriguing flaws that Holmes has, vis-á-vis, tobacco and cocaine. It makes him a bit more fallible; a little more real. I've subsequently bought A Study in Scarlet and The Hound of the Baskervilles (because they too have Whispersync with audiobook), to continue my newly discovered love of old classics."

I never would have bought the book, except that it's free on the Kindle and I needed something to read in a pinch.  I downloaded it, and I'm glad that I did.  The story-telling takes some getting used to, due to the style of English used during that period.  But once you've read a few of the stories, you get used to it.  Among the 12 mysteries in the book, my favorites were ""The Man with the Twisted Lip"" and ""The Blue Carbuncle"".  But all 12 were fun to read."

I thoroughly enjoyed the exploits of Holmes and Watson as they unravel the problems presented to the famous detective.  I feel as if I'm sitting in the drawing room on Baker Street warming by the fire with our heros as Watson and I observe Holmes' mind churning his inexorable logic until the solution presents itself.  The stories in this collection are among the best and most popular of the Holmes mysteries.  The Speckled Band and Orange Pips in particular are frequently rated near the top and are a delight at each reading.  These are classic detective stories at their best.  The stories are easy reading, yet well written, and bite-size for a quick mental snack.  The short stories are perfect for grabbing up and reading one or two while you are between appointments, although I found myself devouring the whole thing in a few sittings, not able to read just one.  I read these on my Kindle, with links to the beginning of each story, and well formatted.  The only exception to this is a problem displaying the British Pound symbol.  However, this does nothing to hinder one's understanding or reading experience.  I highly recommend this collection for any fan of the genre."

But after my recent read of From Holmes to Sherlock by Mattias Boström, I find myself moving any and all Sherlock Holmes stories up on my to-read list. This book is significant because is is one of the only stories to win the seal of approval from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate, his heirs being determined to jealously preserve the Holmes mystique. So with all that in mind, there’s a lot of pressure on Horowitz to deliver not only a good mystery, but also a Sherlock Holmes mystery."

Unfortunately The Sick Rose is not a patch on The Poison Tree. The characters are not overly believable and  are poorly sketched. My feeling is that if the book had been longer there would have been a chance to develop the cast. The whole book felt rushed, possibly there was pressure to publish a second novel and Ms. Kelly felt she had to dish-up an undercooked book. Who knows! Hopefully the third novel (if there is one) will be better thought out and a better read. Having said all this it's an okay novel to while away a couple of hours but if I'd read this before The Poison Tree I wouldn't have sought out any more titles by this author."

It was nothing like the movie, much like the book world war z is nothing like the movie. It's hard to imagine a work of horror like this being written 60 years ago and by the end you can see how Mr Matheson would have been a great fit to write Alfred Hitchcock shows and books. I was surprised by the writing style and how much 50-60 years has made a difference in how we speak and write, not bad just different. I gave the book 4/5 stars not because it's not good, just because I was not a fan of the ending and I felt it could have been more expanded upon. If you enjoy a good read and a classic story then pick this book up and give it a try. It's a masterpiece and that is the reason why it has been made into a movie soooo many different times."

I am somewhat skeptical of what everyone else thinks is good because I like to form my own opinions.  It's not that I go out looking for things with bad reviews, (because most of the time, they're right *grin*) just that I don't like to be overly influenced by other people.  However in this case I can assure you, the hype is all that.  All the stories in this collection are worth your while.  Some are funny, some gross, all intriguing.  I am Legend is the stand alone best though.  It reminded me of The Omega Man, a movie with Charleton Heston, or perhaps it should be other way around. . .I am not sure about the dates.  The one ""true"" man against a world of monsters.  It is fantastic, people at work kept giving me strange looks because of how obivously into the book I was.  I read it very fast, then again, it goes fast once you get past I am Legend, which takes up most of the book.  The book is set up with I am Legend which is like 126 pages or so, and the others are kind of tag alongs, they don't deal with the first story at all, in fact none of the stories are related in any way, but as I said before, each have their own flavor and I loved each one and began to respect Mr. Matheson more and more as I went on.  Check it out, if you're into horror, you don't know what you're missing.  Five worthy stars!"

It left a very long lasting impression of what it means to be utterly isolated and completely alone.  A terrifying prospect for most of us.  Throw in the fact that you are completely surrounded by souless former human beings, and it becomes an unbearable premise.  Richard Matheson pioneered this concept in literature to great effect.  Witness the number of similar books that have been written since.  Not to mention the three (that I am aware of) film renditions:  The Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price, The Omega Man, with Charlton Heston, and now the first film to actually bear the title of the book. I look forward to the new film.  Although I'm not sure Will Smith was the right casting choice.  We'll see.  At one time Arnold Schwarzeneger had planned to film and star in another remake!  That would have been an interesting signature film for his acting career.  In any case.  This book still has the ability to chill and make one feel the unbearable loneliness of the protaganist. It also evokes the atmosphere, quite effectively, of an empty (of humanity), lonely world.  New fans of this genre should find this book affecting and entertaining, if somewhat dated.  (It was written in 1953 after all!) I recommend it highly."

(""Witch War"" one of the more twisted of these, with the Voodoo doll story from the 70's camp classic ""Trilogy of Terror"" being another)"

This collection is no exception.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, or even if you've never read any of Doyle's Sherlock stories before, this book is a good continuation/introduction of the world-famous sleuth.  However, if you'd like to start out at the 'beginning', I suggest reading the novels first, like I did.  I purchased The Complete Illustrated Novels of Sherlock Holmes and read those first.  Then I read this collection of short stories.  I will next be purchasing and reading The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.  This order I have listed, from what I have gathered, contains Doyle's works in chronological publishing order.  The only reason I would suggest reading them in this order is that later stories make mention of events and characters from the earlier novels and stories."

I don't like to be the person to give away spoilers. Therefore my book reviews are always very short and only say a few things in order to tell you, book reviews are much to subjective and I never read a book review before I read a book.

For example, a few of the cases' victims are all enticed by money to do something, then find that it is suspicious, so they seek help from Holmes. A few of the cases sadly involve family conflict, with money and greed being the biggest issues. I liked the last two cases the most, the adventure of the Beryl Coronet and Copper Beeches.

It may seem hard to believe, but Conan Doyle was an important influence on the entire field of criminal investigation.  Before Sherlock Holmes, there was little emphasis on scientific examination of crime scenes or evidence.  Doyle's characterization of Inspector Lestrade as a plodder seems to have been quite correct and quite typical..  With the debut of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet there was suddenly an example of what was possible. The explanations of his approach and method caused real detectives to question themselves and say ""I could do that"".  And slowly but surely they did too.  And Holmes set the change in motion."

Their daughter Biscuit struggles to find her place in the family constantly challenging them and being somewhat mischievous in a calculating way. Their son Paul enters teen-hood and is a relative outcast at school. Others, including John's daughter from a previous relationship Jesse, enter the story and play big roles in helping the core family get back together and maintain some normal existence. In the end, the book is about grief but really to me it is about trust and how far you will go with a partner who you may or may not trust anymore.

But it's not, it's a novel and the story narrative was well done and allowed us to get to know all the members of the Ryrie family and connect with them and their emotions. Some of the descriptions and 'moments' are jarring and made the book seem out of balance or a derail, but the author quickly gets back to the story at hand and I felt those moments actually gave the book it's best writing. For me, 'The Grief of Others' is a 4 and only a little choppiness kept a very good book from being great."

It lacked the subtle nuance that goes into a Dekker tale, and it also lacked the suspense and wonder when the mystery is revealed. The fact that I knew who the ""bad guy"" was the minute he was introduced was also unfortunate. Still fairly well-written, and I'd give Rubart another chance in the future."

I very much enjoyed it - it's such a creative story and I loved the idea to have the main characters spiritual battle play out in his physical world as well.  Also, the ending was really moving and eye-opening for me.  I didn't give it 5-stars because throughout the book when there wasn't anything intense going on, the writing seemed really forced and didn't flow easily for me.  That's just a personal opinion, so don't take it too much to heart.  I just thought there were times when the writing was really overly descriptive in a way that wasn't very smooth or natural.  The similes and metaphors were just a little much at times, making it hard to get through those sections without losing all focus.  All in all, it was a great book with a great message."

The atmosphere in this novel and the plot twists really are a homage to Doyle. Shows like Elementary & Sherlock running simultaneously are a testament to Doyle.  I admired Horowitz's writing of scripts for Midsomer Murders & he does an equally wonderful job in House of Silk.  Now on to his novel Moriarty!

He so captured the style of Arthur Conant Doyle that I thought it was absolutely written by Doyle from the grave.  Not only was the style captured, but all the characters, Watson, Holmes and the minor ones, were portrayed as if written by the 19th Century author.  Bravo to Horowitz and to the Conan Doyle estate who granted Horowitz the right to write this novel.  I would highly recommend this book to Sherlock Holmes fans."

However, modern writers seem to want to ""humanize"" Holmes by over analyzing him.  Holmes epitomized the Victorian Age.  An age of both prudishness and the industrialization of Europe and the English speaking world.  Holmes was written as a ""thinking machine"" the equivalent of Dr. Who without the Tardus.  That being said, I enjoyed reading the book and thought its plot worthy of Doyle and very timely."

As the mother of a child who has benefitted from the type of music listening therapy programs discussed of in this book, as well as a practitioner of music listening therapy myself, I was eager to read this book- it did not disappoint!  I have a tendency to skip through books, reading here and there.  It is a good book when I read straight through- and do it in under a month!  I found this book to be a quick read and enjoyed every minute of it.  There is some material in the book that is more innately known by many people, but the authors do an amazing job at explaining how and why music affects us as it does- physically, mentally, emotionally, etc.  My favorite chapter (I think 4?) discusses more of the physiological changes that happens when certain music is playing- such as an increase (or decrease) in heart rate.  The authors also touch upon the amazing benefits of playing/listening to music- such as higher IQ's, lower stress, and living longer and more productive lives.  I am really energized to re-teach myself the violin that I stopped playing years ago, introduce my children to instruments, as well as incorporating music listening into our lives more.

I loved this book ... all of it.  Even though the ending was unexpected, or wanted (LOL), I can certainly imagine a book two with a surprise beginning!

But having no writing skills was in a quandary as to whom to ask to tackle his momentious task. Of course I accepted the duty with great relish (and enjoyment, I must add). After the prodigious job was completed I queried, ""Who will illustrate your work, my dear Sherlock?"" ""It's elementary, my dear Watson,"" he exclaimed. ""Only Sidney Padget is up to the task!""

The stories vary, but all are intriguing, showcasing the observation skills of the Master Detective. Truth be known, Dr Watson contributed much to the work, and I believe he was an actual person. Holmes had a drug habit, not illegal at that time, and probably an effort to hold his tremendous intellect in check. Eventually, he overcame it, and took a few years sabbatical, as it were, where he dropped out of sight to peruse the world cultures outside of England. I enjoyed reviewing the stories again, having read them years ago as a erstwhile detective. Some might say the book is ""elementary"" but the depth is cleverly hidden."

This was a pleasant shift in the trend. Often when a writer chooses a central theme--in this case grief--she fails to make sense of the connection, but Cohen does this beautifully, sensibly, subtly, but not so obscurely that it stretches credibility. The characters are poetically drawn, the relationships comfortable, and the writing engaging from the first page."

The first pages of this novel are a masterpiece, a portrayal of grief  exquisitely rendered. The rest of the book fulfills the promise of those pages. But this is not just a novel about grief; it's also about the many facets of love and family and life on earth.  It often makes you smile, or laugh out loud, or creates in you some sort of recognition that makes you want to shout ""Yes! That's just how it is!""  I loved every character, even--and perhaps especially-- when they were behaving badly. This is Cohen's best book yet, and now that I've finished it, I'm eagerly awaiting her next work."

There are many great lessons and examples that the book provides for teaching ELA in Early Childhood and Elementary classes. Walther provides great insights into what strategies make these lessons work. This is where I feel the book is kind of lacking because I wanted more detail on ""why"" these strategies work. I also feel as though we are being teased with ways to instill aesthetic learning, but never really crossing the line from surface level learning. To give credit, Walther's does remind readers of student intersectionality. Just because it works in one class, doesn't mean it will work in all classes."

I'd seen parts of the Will Smith movie. A deadly plague had struck Robert Neville's world. All the people he's known (friends, his wife, his daughter) are dying. That's bad enough, but they don't stay dead. They come back hungry for blood, infecting others. Soon, Robert is the only one left alive. At least that's what he believes."

I read the whole thing in one stretch and it was nearly responsible for me missing a flight as I sat in the lounge saying ""I'll walk to my gate once I finish ONE more chapter.""  If you've seen the Will Smith movie, you get the general gist.  But a single-character story is much better suited to book-form where you can more easily access the thoughts and emotions of that character.  While it has action, unlike the movie, it isn't really an action-based story"

The story starts with our hero hunting and killing vampires and ends up being the story of perception.  At times I felt the story was quite slow moving, but I believe that is part of the telling, because there are no other humans to help this man make the time pass.  I read several of the 1 and 2 starred reviews and I feel most of them were unjust because they were expecting the book version of the Will Smith movie.  Readers should know this book was written in 1954 and has the feel of the same era.  It is not a slash bang smash em up.  It is a commentary."

People could easily get rejected thinking ""oh it's a horror"" but it's not. I would sound probably cocky or something if say ""I can relate to this book a lot"" but it is not because I think too highly of my self and it does not have any connection with the title, but it is because I had difficult times in my youth growing up through the surrounding that was really dark and people were really a mental wreck. And I could relate to Robert Neville's emotional difficulties and how hard it feels to meet that normal person that is almost impossible to find. That's what kept me through the book that I read 1-2 chapters a day. But seeing how he became a legend it left a mark on me of how through all those things he went through the book, he never changed his core self. And probably because it's a book and not a movie, it somehow stays so deep within you. It is awesome."

You can't do that with the new Glowlight, apparently. Otherwise, the Glowlight works perfectly and is a real boon to anyone who wants to read in bed and leave the bedside light off.

If you're a lover of classic mystery stories, as I am, this book will be a delight. The collection contains stories as chronicled by Sherlock Holmes' able bodied assistant James Watson, The mysteries are always intriguing to Holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner. Once you begin to read you will be taken back to old England in a time where the world was just beginning to use science as a means of development rather than warfare and chivalry was still alive and kicking, this book is a must read for all you book lovers!!"

There were a lot of strange word choices, over-wordiness, repetition of words, and some bad grammar, to-boot! A good editor could have corrected most of these flaws (and glaring typos). The style of writing was not smooth: sentences that had to be read over again to  make sense, and still didn't; scene breaks where skilful transitions would have made for a better flow; narrative that jumped unnecessarily in time within chapters. All in all, too many characters for the length of the book, which detracted from the most interesting story (Eva's). The alternating chapters with the different viewpoints and time periods made for a choppy read, and, as another reviewer pointed out, I felt Eva's story was not naturally told in the third person. Who writes their memoirs this way? It introduced a sense of distance to the immediacy of the events, which got more suspenseful as the book progressed, but which could have been even more suspenseful. There was a lot to like about this book--interesting insights and erudite information, some brilliant description. It just could have been so much better..."

The plot sounded fascinating, but the execution just didn't hold my interest. I found myself looking to see how far along I was, percentage wise. I stopped sixty percent of the way through. The dialog between the characters was stultifying and the story just plods along. I know one should read the whole book and then write a review so my opinion is based on the first half of the book.

Or, that Jamie Lee Curtis onece cut all fat from her diet and ate nothing but vegetables to get a role in a movie?! Not only that, but this book also includes many success stories of people who have been on diets and came out happy and appreciative of their bodies.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, some of the tips are unhealthy.  Okay.  You need to research a diet program before you begin, anyway.  Some of the tips are absolutely FABULOUS and as we all should know, it's the little things you change about your diet that can really help you lose weight.  And even if some of the celebrity dieting tricks are unhealthy, who doesn't want to know what the celebrities do to stay all fit and fab...aka skin and bone."
1132,1568659121,R149Y9TSL633XF,You will LOVE this book! It really caters to everyone...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2003",16 people found this helpful,,"Aargh! I cant understand why this book got a 3/5. I guess it is most likely because people are criticizing the author on her lack of scientific information. BUT this book is valuable in so many ways. Perhaps most importantly, it is a lot of fun to read. I find myself perusing it often, and it keeps me motivated to stay healthy and it offers so many different approaches to health that you will never get bored with a regimen. The author offers dieters and people who are looking for ways to cut calories in general a HUGE variety of tips and tricks that are INEXPENSIVE (so inexpensive, I am a poor college student and find virtually all of her suggestions doable). The author has not done scientic research but has approached this subject in (I think) a much more valuable way, that is journalistically. Instead of buying some doctor's get rich fad diet book that works in theory but not in practice, you can buy this book and learn what celebities do to keep their weight down. Not that I am all that interested in celebrities, but when you consider that their fortunes rely a lot on their looks, you can trust that they know what works-at least for them. That is really the best thing about this book. It is so chock full of interesting tidbits, that you are bound to find some ideas that you can incorporate into your own lifestyle. So while not all suggestions will be relevant to you now (but who knows, maybe in a few years they will be), you are sure to find some tips that will be very valuable to you. The recipes in the back are also EASY to do, with no exotic ingredients to hunt down. Also, the author tells a lot of non celeb stories, and that is just as valuable if not more that her recounting of the celeb stories. This is an EXCELLENT book if you are just starting out as well, it will DEFINITELY get you motivated, and also theres a valubale lil part that makes you think about why you overeat. what more could you want in a diet book?"

My friend recommend I read telling me how the ending left him speechless, and now having read it myself I can definately say it is the best ending of any book I've ever read.  The concept is that Nevelle is the last man alive due to a virus that changed everyone else into vampires.  The book starts with him making repairs to the outside of his, which he does every day due the damage the vampires do trying to get in at night.  His house has become his fort, the only thing that protects him each night from them.  He can't stray too far away during the day cause he needs to have enough time to get home and seal himself up at night, which removes any hope of him finding any survivors beyond a certain radius. By day he wonders out for supplies when he needs them and reinforces his house, and by night he locks himself in and tries to ignore the vampires outside trying to get him to come out.  The book is mostly about this one remaining man who's all alone, researching and trying to figure out what the virus is and how it works. At the end he is in a situation which explains the title of the book.  The book is very short, I was disappointed when I Am Legend ended after only 100+ pages with the rest being short stories.  But for such a short story it is still incredibly powerful and intresting, and the other short stories are worth a read too.... Don't let the movie ruin it for you, while it follows the same concept as the book it leaves out all the things that make the book so good.  They should be punished for changing the ending to the way they did.... BOO Hollywood...... LATE"

It would be terrible to be the last person on earth and this book paints a picture more detailed from a human point of view than the Day of the Triffids and yet not a lot occurs in the story. It feels a bit like the darker parts of Stocker's Dracula such as the scenes where Harker is trapped in the count's castle."

Whenever I am reading a good book at work and my phone rings; I jump so badly that my heart pounds for several minutes after the scare. This happened to me many times during the book. I became one hundred percent engrossed with the isolation feeling that the main character was experiencing. Then suddenly...BANG, the story abruptly ends mid-way through the book. I sat there scratching my head feeling very perplexed. This is something that anyone who is considering buying this book MUST KNOW. The book actually contains numerous short stories. I still highly recommend purchasing it though. It was different from the movie and I personally feel that it was just as good as the movie."

It became my favorite horror film because it requires deep thinking and analysis of what the world--and your psyche--would be like when you are the last remaining ""normal"" human being. Movies based on books can be so far apart from the orignal story that it would seem that the name was highjacked only as a box-office draw. This book while not the same has all the darkness and developed ethos and pathos of ""The Omega Man."" I would--and will--read this book several more times in my life. It so well written that I wish the ""great"" authors would write more books like this. If you are a horror and/or sci-fi fan, here is a great book for you. If you are a modern day pseudo-vampire, you will be disappointed for there is no romance related to the life of a vampire. The author makes it is clear that the dead are really dead, the tertiary beings--who are now the new species of homo-sapien--are deluded, and Neville is and always will be Legend. This book the perfect companion for a long airline flight."

I felt that the collection should have been a bit longer. In today's post-Doyle world there are two different approaches to making Sherlock Holmes characters, consistent with Arthur Canon Doyle's work or only in name similar.  Movies, and television have simulated caricatures of some form or another of the main people and this has made the classic writing harder to relate to if there is not enough writing to redeveloped the characters anew.  The collection might have been enough at one time but the collection exists now in a multimedia world and those characterizations invade the original which makes the original, need more support of character development to offset the preconceived notions. I know this is harsh and is not a critique of the author but it is a fact of losing poetic license."

However these mysteries are more for enjoying the journey, not trying to solve the mystery yourself. I would have liked some of them to be about twice as long as they were.

Horowitz was one of the first authors to be officially endorsed by the Conan Doyle Estate, and not only uses the same characters but tries to emulate Doyle’s style as well. The novel begins with Holmes and Watson having a conversation with Edmund Carstairs, a middle-class man who believes someone has followed him back from America to torture and kill him. The case takes a turn when Ross a homeless boy that Holmes employs, is murdered as well as the discovery of the House of Silk, a secret society which seemingly operates at the highest levels of government. Throughout this narrative, poverty is intertwined into almost every scene and action. I believe that Anthony Horowitz successfully portrays the poverty plaguing the streets of Victorian London as well as emulates Doyle’s style, but he falls flat when faced with the cast of characters."

In that time I have read, watched, and played all the derivative works. Most are passable at best, some are offensive, a precious few stir me to an emotion. This has become, for now, the Great Work of homage to Holmes that all others should aspire to attain. The voice and method and pulse of it were perfect. For once I wasn't reading about an action hero with a supposed genius that solves more with violence. It was Holmes, the mind to equal the whole of London's police and criminal syndicates. I am becoming too hyperbolic so let me sum up with this-"

I really liked the author's style.  However, the further I tried to read, the more I developed a dislike for it.  At first the rooms appearing seemed weird, but when it got to the room that it was 'himself' in the room, it was just silly to me.  I'm sure there is some subliminal message or thought to the story line, but I lost interest.  I don't want to have to guess what an author is saying."

The grief, guilt, misery, woe, complexity - you name it - are all laid on with a trowel and, for me, that made it hard to relate to. It got unbelievable very fast and at time was almost a parody.

Hager Cohen writes beautifully, with almost poetic observation, but this cannot disguise the plodding plot of The Grief of Others.  It's unfortunate that there is an absence of intrigue in the novel - the subject matter is heart-wrenching and could have drawn in even the most emotionally-devoid reader but it doesn't. The family in this book have suffered a tragic loss with the death of their newborn son only 57 hours after his birth, due to the tragic defect Anencephaly.  This isn't the focus of the novel, however - it focuses (as suggested by the title) on the family's grief, or rather the lack of it as it would appear to others."

I understand it has to be modernized but at least they could have made a better effort. This story reveals what loneliness can actual feel like and what it can truly do to a person. How many people can truthfully say they're alone, utterly and completely isolated from anyone who can feel your pain or excitement and can truly converse with you. In this world of connectivity and social exposure I wouldn't think there would be many at all. The movie sensationalized the vampire aspect of the book instead of the true purpose of the story. This book is, as usual, much better than the movie and very different in the story. Enjoy!"

In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous!  She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own.  Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money."

First, I loved the interviews with successful dieters.  Real stories (very blunt) about marriages breaking up, embarassing moments, you name it.  Then, I liked the research that Ms. Irons has done with scientists explaining myths and supplements.  Another area that this book has that no other diet book does is how to look your best while going down the scale.  That's a great approach!  What really makes me use this book each day to keep me motivated are the absolutely delicious recipes (about 100).  Not only are they easy to use, but they're all under 200 calories.  Cookies, meatloaf, even chocolate truffles (60 calories).  I've read every diet book on the market, not any come close to a realistic life plan.  This does it all!"

Ms. Irons has done her homework, and has covered everything from supplements (with warnings!) and mind games that really work!  I would have paid $14.95 for the 100 recipes all under 200 calories alone.  The rest (spa secrets,anti-bloating, dressing thinner,) is an absolute bargain!!"

It reminds one of the real story of Soviet spy Melita Norwood, outed by defector Vasili Metrokin in the early nineties. Her daughter and family were totally unaware of her espionage role until the truth was revealed when she was in her eighties. Boyd's elderly spy is believable. However, I think the writer missed the mark when trying to write from a female perspective, especially with daughter Ruth. Perhaps the spy's child should have been a boy!"

The quality of the GlowLight when used was spectacular, the features where easy to use.  Then tiny ""cracks / lines"" started to appear in the screen / light which made it difficult to use at first; then as more appeared the device became completely unusable.  This device was not abused in anyway. It was kept in a case, not dropped, etc..  After further searching concerning this problem, it is not uncommon.  A significant number of people reported the same problem even though their care of the device was good.  The most disturbing part of all this is that the manufacturer of the product has known about this problem and to date the item is still being sold with the defect.  I was so disappointed because other than this problem I loved my NOOK Simple Touch with GlowLight.  I now have a Kindle Paperwhite, it is similar to the Nook but just enough difference that except for the defect I like the Nook by a slight margin but not enough to invest in a defective product again.  In addition, there is difference between customer service for both devices. The Nook customer service regarding defects / returns / replacements is poor compared to the good reports of customer service with the Kindle.  Wanted to like the NOOK Simple Touch but couldn't risk it."

I recently began watching the BBC series, Sherlock, and instantly was captivated by it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman convincingly and magnificently portrayed Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, and the writing of the show was equally impressive. Once I had finished season 1, which didn't take long as most Sherlockians know, I turned to the original Sherlock Holmes book series, to bide my time waiting for season 2 to air in America. I downloaded this copy of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" on to my iPad, only because of the cover. The stories are incredible. Captivating and interesting, I could barely put the book down, unfortunately enough for my grades! At the end of the book, I found I had a better appreciation for the work Moffat and Gatiss put into the new series and for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories."

Whilst the subject matter is worthy, I felt that the characters became rather self-obssessed and this made it a frustrating and slightly nauseating read.  Maybe this is deliberate; making them so divisive as of course the reader feels empathy with the characters for the awful experience of losing a child, and everyone has their own opinion on how they would handle the same situation themselves."

Instead it seems to center mainly on other characters, mainly the couples children,including a child from a previous relationship. It goes back and forth in time and from character to charater. I found it to be very frustrating and hard going I wanted to give up half way through but carried hoping it would eventually focus more on the couple and their feelings and how they delt with their baby`s death but not so.

I was going to college and working at night near the airport in Seattle, and that night it snowed so bad I had to turn back or risk getting stuck on the highway, already full of abandoned cars and trucks.  I got home and tromped to the mailbox, at least warmed by the idea my present to myself had arrived.  It was this book, of course."

Anyone that has seen the movie AND read the book should be equally insulted. The novel has a wonderful dark and haunting  atmosphere, which by the way is NOT set in New York City!  Robert Neville is a brooding alcoholic layman who AFTER the ""plague"" has to teach himself science and virology between periods of drunken depression, he is NOT a colonel and brilliant scientist with a loving companion German Shepard."

1327,1433203324,R9JLI9EEGO4L0,An excellent novella exploring the theme of isolation.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2014",,Verified Purchase,"Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is an excellent story that differs widely from the typical zombie/vampire/apocalypse text. This story follows protagonist Robert Neville who is the survivor of a disease that has killed or mutated everyone else in the world. In addition to mourning his own family, Robert is tormented by the 'undead' who call to him from outside his barricaded house every night. What makes this book so interesting is that it explores the human side to Robert, his isolation, his longing for companionship, and his fight to avoid becoming mad. It also depicts Robert's level of knowledge and intelligence in a realistic way. Robert is not a scientist, but is able to gain a strong base of knowledge about the disease by his own research from the public library. I enjoyed this book because of the excellent depiction of Robert as the protagonist. This book was easy to read and enjoyable, and I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys 'disaster' type stories, and also people who are interested in the psychology underlying isolation."

Watson is droll and Sherlock is profound and Mycroft and Co are all that would be hoped - like visiting old friends.

Slow at 1st, picked up after reading 20% & n fact, was biting my nails towards the conclusion, as horrible a crime as ever committed.

1351,1409133826,R3528SBRYSLLL5,Is this the final Sherlock Holmes mystery?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2015",2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This is truly an excellent effort by the author to write a story that passes for Arthur Conan Doyle writing Sherlock Holmes.  There are a few times in the story where the syntax is a little more contemporary than ACD would have used, but all in all, the illusion is very well done, and the book draws the reader completely into London of the 1890's.  The story is more shocking in its content and premise than any other Sherlock Holmes mystery, and the ending chapter brings it all together so neatly, and with a bang, that the reader can only marvel at the construction of the novel.  Instead of a single story, there are two intertwining story lines here running parallel paths that intersect in the last third especially.  The good vs. evil features prominently as in all Holmes mysteries, but the story will leave you shaking your head at the final intersection, and I found myself wondering if Anthony Horowitz had any intentions of writing more about Sherlock Holmes.  If he did (or does) I will be in line for the next installment - well done indeed!  I understand that the ACD estate has found this story alone worthy of their endorsement, and it is easy to see why.  IMO if you liked Conan Doyles' Sherlock Holmes you are quite likely to like this."

The only reason for a missing star is the author did not include classics; I hope she writes another volume that includes them."

Robert Neville, a former factory worker, is the sole surviving human being as far as he knows.

During the day, he fortifies his home, kills vampires, and even researches the cause of the plague.  Neville is obsessed with explaining what has happened in rational, scientific terms and discovers a bacteria that appears to be the root of the problem.  His struggles to stay alive and find a purpose for his life form the crux of the story."

The only problem I had with the movie, was that you sat through 3 hours worth of movie, you still didn't really know anything about the main character. It was flat, he wasn't developed and you didn't have the chance to emotionally connect with him. The book is amazing and fills in all the gaps that the movie may have left you wondering about. Richard Matheson is a creative genius."

The movie was changed so much from the book.  I saw the movie first and was shocked how different the book was... and I mean completely different.  The book tells about Robert Neville and how he survived the 'virus'.  It tells about how he lost his family, but the entire book is just him.  Except for at night when the vampires try to get in.  In  the end, he gets a visitor who he goes with.  He eventually learns that the vampires are adapting and are able to be out in the sun for periods of time."

It is interesting that this book spawned three different movies (four if you count Night of the Living Dead).  The story is little better than pulp fiction, but it started two whole genres of horror-fiction.  I guess that says a great deal by itself.  It is worth reading for its importance as the genesis of both vampire/ghoul/zombie apocalypse and lone plague survivor style fictions.  If literature is defined by what it inspires, than this is it."

It is a dark tale of the end of the human race, as we know it. A bioengineered virus has gotten loose in the world and all of mankind has succumbed. The protagonist is the only human he knows of that is still alive. And, he is under siege. The virus has transformed the population into vampires, and they are anxious for him to join them. The story is told from the protagonist's POV, and delineates his transformation from survivor to monster. Rereading this book as an adult changed my perspective on some of the events in the book. It was a great pleasure reading it again."

I saw the movie and was intrigued to read the original novel and i'm glad I did. The authot does an amazing job of putting you inside the mind of a man who has literally been alone for months. As cheesey and over-done as the whole vampire genre is, for a book that was written in 1954, Matheson added a new perspective to the classic myth by scientifically explaining what and how vampires come to be. The book is action-packed like the movie yet is very different in events that take place; for example, in the movie Robert had the dog from the beginning of the movie whereas in the book he finds the dog walking around the neighborhood one day. The ending is also amazing! Very surprising and totally different from the movie. In the movie he's called a legend because he discovers the vaccine for vampirism........in the book he's called a legend for a completely different reason!"

It is a quick and entertaining read - especially for being written in 1954. I'm not really in to vampires, but this isn't about vampires. It's about a man who is the last man on earth and he's trying to deal with being alone, and trying to figure out what has happened to the rest of his race. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some light summertime reading"

Over the years, read-aloud has been slowly reduced to a scripted basal reading process with controlled questions and step by step recipes. Maria shares her thinking for read-aloud with just two pages of flexible suggestions that read more like ""possibilities"" than a plan. Her open-ended recommendations do what no program could ever do - celebrate the role of professional decision-making by inviting teachers to the read-aloud process. I am so grateful for that refreshing view!"

I have seen the movie ""I Am Legend"" (2007) and an earlier movie version of Matheson's story, ""The Omega Man"", starring Charlton Heston (1971).  I think I prefer the written word, in this case, to either of the Hollywood renditions."

I thought it might have extra detail into the depth of the character Robert Neville, a character I really I liked. However, while the book is quite good as literature, it is quite different from the movie; a fact I knew but I just did not know how different. In the book, our Robert is not a scientist or in the Army and the true origin of the vampire-creating disease is not given. He does however try to figure out as best he can what has happened. He also grapples with his loneliness and the human side of being alone, more so than in the movie. In the book he is not accompanied by a his trusting dog Sam. Robert Neville is essentially not the same as in the movie; which is fine because that was the way the movie makers wanted it. So even though the movie is based on the book, you have to look at each work different, and don't judge one by the other. With the version of the book I received there were also some short stories by the author which I did not expect. I liked the book and it was/is good but I preferred the movie. After you read and see you might think different."

He is able to create rivalry between survival of the body and survival of the spirit.  This story is beautifully constructed for those who are seeking entertainment deeper than the obligatory thrills and chills of a typical horror story.  However, within I Am Legend, you will absolutely find action packed moments that will keep you greedily turning page after page.  Matheson with his main character, Neville, has penned a severely sentimental, post-apocalyptic, horror-romance-nightmare.  A classic and a must read."

Up until this point I had never done any extensive studying of a particular book, just stand alone versus, so the fact that I shook with the anticipation of learning what would happen next (to this poor soul - as I liked to refer to him at the time) floored me. Over the years I have continued to study the bible, reading scripture and trying (sometimes is vain) to make it make sense to me. Sometimes I fail horribly, while other times the message I read sparks like a lightning bolt to my brain, I get it instantly. Now, after all these years one fact remains... I remember the book of ""Job"" more than any other book I have ever read. Why am I telling you all of this you may ask? Because ""Job"" has just come back to life in James L Rubarts' novel ""Rooms"""

I have hunted for this book for years, ever since I saw the movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price. And when I finally found it, I  wasn't disappointed. The book was better than the movie (of course)!  Matheson draws you in with the haunting idea of the last man on earth in a  world of vampires. Even though he attempts to discover the cause of the  plague, many things are left unanswered, which only adds to the horror. I  have read this book more times than I can count, and almost always in one  sitting. As an aspiring author, Matheson has inspired me.

1548,1433203324,R19PFHYMU7BGGK,The Monster:,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2015",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Despite it's deliberate slow pacing this is one of the most chilling novels of the 20th Century.  Written in 1954 by Richard Matheson ""I Am Legend"" takes a close look at what it means to be human and what it takes to become inhuman.  Robert Neville is the last man on Earth, but he is not alone!  The rest of the human race has died, victims of a mysterious plague that has infected everyone and has a 99% fatality rate.  The problem is, the dead won't stay dead!  Urban legends of The Undead, Vampires, have been with us for centuries, is it possible that these legends have a basis in scientific fact? Matheson explores that possibility from the viewpoint of one man, while also delving into that man's troubled mind.  Beyond the mundane problem of just staying alive; getting enough food, water and shelter, there is the very real problem of being totally alone.  Alone, with his dark thoughts, fighting alcoholism, painful memories of his past life and how his wife died, twice, all combine to threaten his sanity and his life. But there are external threats to his life as well.  The Undead, hungry for Neville's living flesh and blood, surround his fortified house each night where they fight among themselves and seek access to his home.  During the day things are reversed.  Unlike the Undead, Neville can come out in the sunlight and is free to roam the city looking for the sleeping Undead and to drive wooden stakes through their hearts.  But even as he wages his pointless war against the Vampires, Neville realizes that his vendetta can't go on forever, he must find another way.  Questions fill his mind.  Why are the Vampires repulsed by things like garlic and the Holy Cross?  What is it about the sun light that burns their flesh?  If this is a plague then there must be a cure, someway to save what is left of humanity, if there is any humanity left to save.  Dark, brooding and, at times, depressing ""I Am Legend"" is a true classic of Horror Fiction.  Richard Matheson's low key prose dominated the Speculative Fiction field from the mid 20th century to the early 21st century.  Weather it was a shrinking man, a terrified airline passenger at 20,000 feet or a lonely traveling salesman being stalked by a psychotic trucker, this author excelled at placing ordinary men into extraordinary situations.  ""I Am Legend"" is such a novel and Hollywood was quick to see it's potential with three different films: The Last Man on Earth 1964, The Omega Man 1971 and I Am Legend 2007.  While all three were faithful to the original story, each one deviated from the novel in its own special way to create a unique take on the ""Last Man"" scenario.  In the novel, as well as the screenplays, I wondered why the central character did not just pack up and leave the city, seek out an isolated place in whatever wilderness there was and find some measure of peace.  Neville himself had no answer for that question, but maybe you will.  I first read this in my early teens, so reading it now is like revisiting an old friend, but I wonder how modern readers will take to it.  In this day of high-action entertainment like ""The Walking Dead"" some readers might get impatient with ""I Am Legend's"" low-key approach but, I think, if they give it a fair chance they may find it to be an important look at the human phyche and what happens when things go terribly wrong.  I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition."

Such a brilliant story-telling of choosing who and what you will devote your life to... Helped me to see the stark contrasts in choosing Jesus.  It also shows how cleverly deceptive Satan is in trying to get us to follow him without knowing that is what we are doing.  I cannot wait to read all of James Rubart's books!"

The House of Silk is among the better written Sherlock Holmes pastiches and it has its moments of adventure and danger, but overall I'd say this was a so-so story.  The beginning of the tale and the moment Holmes finds himself in trouble through to the conclusion of the story was a page turner, but everything in between was slow going and dull.  In addition, I found the inclusion of Mycroft to be something of an unnecessary contrivance as it added nothing to the story and served as an injustice of Mycroft's considerable intellect and influence.  In one of ACD's stories, Mycroft was described as ""the British government,"" but in this story Mycroft was portrayed as fearful & ineffectual, serving only to warn Holmes against his intended actions. Finally,  in the beginning of the story,  Holmes asks a question if Catherine Carstairs can swim at the end of his interview with the Carstairs household which indicated that Holmes already  deduced that Catherine was involved with the burglary and murder. . One has to wonder why he did not address his suspicions immediately other than it might have ended the story right there before Holmes & Watson find themselves embroiled in the House of Silk affair."

I enjoyed both the movies but I was curious how the book played out and I have to say that the book was much more interesting. What's awesome about this book is that the character of Robert Neville feels very authentic. He's just a normal guy, not some action hero or hot shot scientist looking for a cure ... Just a normal guy trying to survive. It's easy to understand why he does what he does and likewise its easy to understand why the vampires do what they do. The end of this book was a very fitting end and one that I am kind of disappointed they didn't transition the the film. I highly recommended this book to anyone who likes vampire stories or stories of survival."

It is a story written in a post-apocalyptic setting.  The hero is what appears to be a lone survivor of the disaster and is having to deal with the results thereof.  I have read that this book has served as inspiration to many of the zombie books and movies from just after it was written through the modern era.  While I'm sure that many will have seen the Will Smith movie version of this book, please do not expect the book to be precisely like the movie."

The story isn't bad but the plot moves so amazingly slooooow.  There were several times I nearly stopped reading and pressed 'next page' on my kindle about 60 times to get to where the plot was actually moving.  The attempt at building suspense (all the unanswered questions Micah had over and over) was just annoying.  A reader can only keep up with so much and I tired of yet another unanswered mystery being added to the storyline every few pages.

With that said the Kindle book is lacking. As I read through the book there are several typos. I don't know if they were missed in translation or if the Kindle reader on my phone has a glitch but when I checked it on my wife's phone it had the same issue. Seems through out the book every time a unit of measure is used (such as the lb sterling symbol) the translator screwed up and just stuck in a bunch of symbols. I really do hope that someone spends some time on this and can fix it. I know that this is enough reason for me to stick with my page turning.

Even though this book is confusing, we liked it because it has a great ending, and can teach several lessons."

I found it to be inspiring, even though it truly paints a desolate picture of the ""future"" (the book takes place in 1976, but was written in the 50's).  I think this book must have played a key role in the development of Justin Cronin's ""The Passage"", in fact I found the similarities striking; so if you enjoyed ""The Passage"" and are looking forward to Cronin's next book ""The Twelve"", you will like this.  It is a quick read, and well worth the time!"

In the realm of post-apocalyptic fiction, if any work deserves to be described as seminal, this is it. Its influence is clearly evident to this day in everything from ""The Walking Dead"" (particularly in the early-going, where a certain character's late wife comes back to haunt him from beyond the grave) to much of dystopian fiction. Never mind that it's been made into a movie no less than three times (1964's ""The Last Man on Earth"" starring the oddly cast Vincent Price--a messy cheapie that's worth a look as the most faithful adaptation of the book and for its own influence on Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""; 1971's memorable ""The Omega Man,"" starring Charlton Heston in his post ""Planet of the Apes"" dystopian sci-fi martyr phase [see also: ""Soylent Green""], who's perfect for the main character in many ways, though the film is drastically reconceived from the source material and frequently has the aesthetics of a made-for-TV movie, and most recently the years-in-production 2007 Will Smith version that retained the title, if little of the f flavor, though there were at least hints that some involved in the production had read the book). This is a book that earns its classic status for multiple reasons. While the Heston and Smith movies have always leaned into the apocalyptic action and away from the primal horror, Matheson crafts a sci-fi nightmare that would be better served by a mid-budget indie drama vibe than a mega-budget thrill-ride."

I enjoyed both movies -- and now I have enjoyed the classic that inspired them as well.  The movies and the book are somewhat similar to each other (and somewhat different as well).  But if you enjoyed either of the movies, you should enjoy this book as well.  A key aspect of both movie and book is the psychological impact of sustained personal isolation (i.e., the lone survivor is not chased by zombies/vampires every night)."

It was gripping, thrilling and moving beyond my wildest dreams. I am amazed at the depth of the story, the imagery, and the overall ride on which it took me. I don't think I could ever come up with the appropriate words to express the depths that this book touched in my soul. I love the way in which the author touched on the subject of angels and their roles in our lives and their place in the divine ordinance of things. The way in which God has complete and utter control over our lives is stunningly shown in this book and also the complete joy that can come when we give everything over to Him who is perfect. I think that if you need some answers, if you are unsure, or even if you already believe, that this is an amazing book for you. I would start here and follow up with a good bible study. I am more and more intrigued by the storyline and intend to follow up with a bible study of my own, based on the book. I can't wait to see what the Word has to say about some of the themes in here, and I have to admit it has opened my heart up more than it has been in a long time.

Felt it had a lot more to offer, even though it did have a relatively satisfying ending. Brief, shocking and to the point, the story is luridly entwined around one man's stance against loneliness, and how he responds to unexpected development. Excellent scientific and biological descriptions of vampire anatomy, good characterisation and solid emotional descriptions, but once again, the tale winds down prematurely. Saddened that the second half of the book is filled with four-page long short stories that, although well written, would better serve as furthered chapters of the headline title."

I loved the fact that the author took something so mystical as a vampire and explained it away in science, creating something biological rather than a monster story. Overall, I really enjoyed reading the book. The imagery and suspense were well executed, making it a quick and interesting read."

I consequently purchased Hell House separately and now I have it twice. My review is primarily to help others who may be interested in more than just I am Legend. As horror literature goes, both of these titles are essential reading. They are classics. The included stories are also very good. I respect the author very much. If you like Hell House and haven't already done so, read Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House""."

He does not do well with his flat and slavish depiction of Holmes and Watson, however.  He would have been better advised to create his own characters, as Will Thomas does so brilliantly in his historical mysteries.  Fans of Doyle would do better with Laurie King and Kim Newman."

In spite of the price this version for the Kindle was a bit disappointing. A huge problem for me was that every time a sum of money was mentioned it was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the correct amount because either there wasn't a symbol for Pounds available or it just didn't transfer properly when it was prepared for the ebook format. It felt as though it was scanned with character recognition software that couldn't read the symbol for Pounds Sterling."

Young) but....other than Micah, I thought most of the characters were pretty flat and only used to tell the story of Micah.  I also like other reviewers felt duped into the Christian thing - very heavy into the bible and Christianity.  However, I got something out of this book but telling you would only ruin part of the story.  Lets just say I like to still that negative voice in my head sometimes.  It made me think of the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' where the character had to ignore those three characters that exist only in his mind.  This book was okay....but not my favorite and I probably won't read it again."

William Boyd never fails to engage the reader even after the book is read. These characters are living during a heightened time of purpose and fear during WWII and later, in current times. Betrayal, deception and survival are central to the story. Our heroine is resourceful, and focused which ultimately saves her life. But this is life now informed by a restlessness shaped by unfinished business that takes over her life, potential joy and peace and never ceases."

It has been slightly updated , the neat part is what ever they have changed , updated  they give you the original phrasing  as along side it . The really great thing is that they also print the whole scripture verse Bunyan is using to support his Auto Biographical Allegory . It also includes the 100 early wood cut pictures in their entirety , ( Note : the hard back would be a great edition to your Library if you do not already have a illustrated Pilgrim's Progress  .  This makes this a great devotional tool and a great teaching tool . God used J.Bunyan in a remarkable way as he had minimal schooling thus he learned to write , spell and compose sentences based on his learning to read and through the study of the English Bible , basically self taught ( I would say Holy spirit taught ,but that might offend some ) . He has been recognized as the first writer of the English Novel . Many doubted that such an unlearned man could have written this book . His response was to write 'The Holy War "" an allegory on the war between Satan and his army in the taking of the City  of Man's Soul  and its recovery by God The Father Son and Holy Spirit and the following attacks made on man's soul for the rest of his mortal life . ( This book also available by Aneko Press ) Note this Aneko Press has a number of Christian Classics in print , Paper back;, hardback ; digital Kindle . They are to be highly commended for the service they are doing to keep these treasures available . First Class would give them 10 stars if I could ."

The version is written in clear modern language.  The Bible Verses are conveniently located so one can easily read and compare them to the way John Bunyan uses them in the story. (The Bible verses are actually written out not just marked)  I have several versions of the Pilgrim's Progress, so I have read this story over and over many times.  I would highly recommend this version and the one written by Barry Horner.  Both of the books have their advantages.  If you have read this story before and you really didn't get anything out of it, I would suggest you buying this version and trying it again.  I have gained different insights with each and every reading."

Those comparisons helped to remind me of the grace and help I have received along the way and the many pitfalls that have challenged this passage.  The picture of the fellow raking the muck, so attentive to his work and missing the gift that was being offered, really resonated with me.  So much in this life competes for our attention, often to the demise of those things that are really, and eternally, important.  With the time that I have left, it is my endeavor to focus on the path that is leading me to my final home with Christ.  That's all, and it's enough!  Praise God!"

Not to give away anything of the plot, twists or turns and spoil the book for anyone who has not had the chance to enjoy reading the book for themselves yet, Pilgrim's Progress in simplest terms is an allegory (a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one) of the spiritual journey Christian goes on as he makes a decision to follow Jesus Christ."

I'm a loyal fan of Conan Doyle's original stories and am wary of any Holmes stories penned by another writer, but with this book, there was no need to worry. The writing is so well done that you'll forget it's not an original story and I loved the fresh look on the Baker Street Irregulars."

It was a very exciting read.  I could hardly put it down and was able to read it in only a few days.  I have read all of Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and find this one to be just as good as any and is written in the same style.  Author Anthony Horowitz did an outstanding job in writing this book.  I would hope he writes many more!

The style, the language, the plot, the characters, the settings and the reminiscences are perfectly done.  The juxtaposition and ultimate connection of two seemingly unrelated story lines is exceptionally well done.  A real treat to read."

It is dark, tragic and enjoyable to read.  Robert Neville is as close to a real person that a fictional character can get, a person trapped between the logic of his mind and the new dark age that has fallen outside his house, a new age of vampires.  This story ALONE is a great reason for buying this book, but wait, there's more.  10 other stories within its covers will delight and entertain you.  In fact, as most of them have been on TV(or the big screen) in one form or the other, they already have."

The movi was just okay.  This book however is a great read and show what the man Robert Neville struggles with as he deals with loneliness, loss, and the struggle to find out what he is dealing with.  This very apocalyptic thriller is a great read and it is hard to believe it was written in the 1950's.  You can tell this is a great precursor to the spike in vampire and zombie novels that are the big craze today.  This novel stands out though in comparison to them and is very interesting."

Not only does it describe the difficulties of being the last person alive,it investigates, in depth, the possible reasons for the apocalypse itself. Fantastic scientific theory, amazing emotional exploration, unequivocal and dangerous encounters. The way its written is as beautiful as the situations itself. Robert Nevil, the main character, is so vulnerable and open with his feelings, you fall right into his POV. Even in a world of zombies and vampires, he reminds me of what it is to be human."

It instantly pulls you in, alternating between the struggles Neville must face psychologically as well as physically it goes deeper into the Horror genre than just running scarred. He has to accept who he must become in order to live in this bleak new future. New plot elements are introduced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat, hopeing and praying that Robert Neville will find the peace he needs to somehow be happy again. In the end, I was completely surprised by what happened."

You really need to be able to access a detailed index in a guide book to make it work.  You also need to be able to comprehend your districts or zones in the country to be able to find things quickly but, every zone in the Table of Contents is labeled with a Korean name instead of a general description like ""northeast"" or ""central mountains"" which the beginner needs when trying to figure their itinerary out.  Maps cannot be quickly referenced either.  Most of these difficulties are likely common to all e-reader guidebooks.  For now I suggest sticking with a printed version, at least for this one."

Bunyan made so many allusions to verses that I found myself only making it a line or to before another entire verse was inserted.

The outstanding application of the King James Scriptures throughout the story from beginning to end will inspire those familiar with God's timeless Word, and educate those who never had the training afforded by reading it's message. I first was exposed to it over 50 years ago, and have since read the biography of John Bunyan, an itinerant tinker imprisioned for preaching without a license back in the mid 1500's when the Church of England had supplanted the Catholic Church and was being used to control the people. John Bunyan spent years in jail, and while there, God used him to write Pilgrim's Progress and other works. A book everyone should read, you will find an example of all of humanity in this story, the good and the bad, the saint and the sinner, the overcomer and the backslider. They are all here along with yourself."
1916,1622452399,R17VEKHL7UYM5O,This is a great book that I never really knew about,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2018",2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This is a great book that I never really knew about.  Somewhere, it was recommended, & when I researched it online, I'm glad I ordered this particular version of the book, because, it has all the original 100+ illustrations, and it has all the related Biblical segments imbedded in the story.  ( rather than listing a reference that you have to look up in the Bible ).  But, either way, it is an amazing story from 1891 that describes a Christian's journey to Mount Zion / Paradise, and his encounters with all the same obstacles that we currently face in life.  The 2nd half of the book is about his family's similar journey, after they all shunned him at the beginning.  A recommended book!"
1917,1622452399,RE12CIZXJ7AW7,"Over-the-top obvious allegory, but still enjoyable",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2019",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Pilgrim’s Progress is a bit of a heavy-handed over-the-top obvious allegory, but I found myself enjoying it. The author did a pretty good job of telling how to get to heaven and navigate through life’s challenges. The version I read had the Biblical references written in the text inside parentheses in italics and I found that took away from the enjoyment of the story and so after a while began to just skip over them. There are quite a few illustrations throughout. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever wanted to read Pilgrim’s Progress, but never got around to it."
1918,1622452399,R30RXE5AGMLAFP,2nd only to the bible in worldwide production. nuff said.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2017",2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"The highest distribution of any book, second only to the bible itself. The bible is the creation from God's point of view, this is an allegory of Christianity from the point of view of a Christian. It does a great job of explaining what you will face as a believer, or maybe explain that what you have already faced isn't abnormal. Is a slave greater than his master? A true Christian's life will be marked, at different intervals, by trials, loneliness, disparagement, harassment, rejection, chaos, peace and joy. This spells it out in a very concise, yet dramatic way. This book will make more sense of different events in your walk with the Lord, using scripture throughout. My children love this book and even the most mature Christian has something to gain from it. If you haven't yet, find your way to the narrow gate, shrugging off scoffers and keeping your eyes on Him."

What I didn't realize, was that this classic vampire yarn is only a novella, and that the rest of this paperback is filled with other short horror stories by the author.  Whereas I Am Legend is still a good read, generally standing the test of time, the other stories are almost comically outdated.  In an era of greatly sophisticated horror films and novels, these short stories of yesterday seem almost like a caricature of themselves, though they must have been scary enough when they were first published. If you're interested in an absorbing vampire tale, definitely pick up a copy of I Am Legend.  Just don't expect it to last for an entire flight across the Atlantic."

This book was different from the movie (aren't they all) and in my opinion was more interesting because it offered a much clearer look inside Neville's head.  His motivations for his actions, his wide-ranging and fast-changing emotions allowed me to connect with him much better than the movie in that I, like many people, have felt these same emotions.  The author did a great job of helping the reader to relate to how he was feeling."

Great little story and a fast read.  I enjoyed it very much just wish it was longer.  This is one of those instances where the movies are probably longer than the book lol.  Although there are slight differences between the book and the movies each follows roughly the same storyline.  If you like dystopian futures and quick reads, this is a book for you."

Chrissy is precious and all the dogs acted like real dogs; Chrissy is extra special but she plays and fears and loves like so many dogs I know. As a dog lover, I enjoyed watching Chrissy and her new parent come to love each other. I am glad that the author address PTSD driven anxiety and she did a great job of it. The mystery was well done and I suspected the culprit but kept changing my mind because there were several reasonable suspects. I recommend the book for anyone who enjoys animals or cozy mysteries.

I read it first and was very shocked at the amount of violence in it.  Dogs getting murdered, people getting murdered, and beaten.  There were also a few references to thoughts of rape by one of the characters.  The story also didn't flow.  It went all over the place and you had to reread frequently to see if they were in the past or present.  I do not feel that the author really described things either I could not vividly picture how things looked.  While it is historical fiction you really don't learn much about WWII.  The other problem that I had with this book is that many of the words were written in Burmese with no explanation of how to pronounce them.  I decided to give it a try though and let my daughter read it.  I was sorry that I did.  She began having nightmares after the scence where the Japanese murder people and kill a dog(this was one of the only parts that was pretty descriptive).  She also became frustrated with the fact that she couldn't read/ pronounce the Burmese words."

This Lonely Planet's guide covers Korea efficiently, in 400 pages, by including details you'll need, and leaving out details on obscure cities rarely visited, and omitting rambling historical notes found in guides such as Moon Handbooks' South Korea (~850 pages!).  For example, Lonely Planet covers Busan's Geumgang Fortress in less than half the text used by Moon Handbooks; however, the latter fails to provide adequate directions on getting there, and forgets to warn of the maddening crowds found on holidays, and weekends - important info included in Lonely Planet Korea. Faced with the challenge of Busan's tens of thousands of restaurants, Moon Handbooks chooses to review NONE and only suggests city areas to look for them, while Lonely Planet Korea gives us helpful reviews of specific restaurants. If like me you plan on spending more than a few days in Seoul, you'll find it useful to combine Lonely Planet Korea with Lonely Planet Seoul, because the latter includes far more detail for your Seoul visit.  Be sure to visit the tourist information centers (found in major airports) upon your arrival and get the free city maps.  I suggest you withdraw extra Won from the ATM's in Seoul (or Busan's Gimhae airport) because you'll find ATM's that accept international cards very difficult to find in cities outside Seoul. Don't buy Moon Handbooks' South Korea unless you're planning a Korea trip length of over a month and need details on obscure cities, and want pages of historical info on every city."

South Korea is full of contradictions, sprawling metropolises juxtaposed with ancient Buddhist and Confucian temples.  The book helps visitors explore those contradictions.  Those planning on living in the country (ESL teachers) may find it lacking after they have exhausted all the sights and activities, but for visitors staying a few months or less, and travelling around Korea (not just sticking to Seoul) will find it plenty sufficient."

However, this is by far the worst lonely planet book I've ever encountered.  I've been severely disappointed by the quality of the information given. i was in South korea for 2 weeks with a couple of days traveling alone outside of Seoul.  My korean friend in seoul was shocked by the quality of information given in the Lonely Planet.  Many locations given in HANGUL were spelled incorrectly (atrocious!).  Times of tourist sites were given incorrectly. (Lets say I had many ill planned days due to this fact.)  The one hostel I tried from the lonely planet was horrible (saranchae in gyeoung ju).  In addition I found inconsistencies within the book itself regarding names of train stations and their translations.  The list goes on. The only thing I found useful was using the book to plan simple travel logistics such as knowing if there was a bus from one city to another.  I found the government tourism office by far more helpful - providing free 24hr. translation, tourist offices in abundance with awesome maps and advice in english.  If you're planning a trip to south korea utilize the official tourism office and website as well as trip advisor (and your hotel/hostel when you arrive!).

I don't mind some typos in a free book, but the e-edition of a book still in print from a professional publishing house (Bloomsbury) ought to mirror the 'real' book in every detail.

Why? Because, for example, it includes absolutely NO coverage of one of South Korea's larger cities, Ulsan, which is famous for being the home of the international Hyundai motor company, and was also one of the host cities during the World Cup in 2002. The population is over 1 million people, and to think that such a significant (if slightly industrial) city could be overlooked is proof that the authors of this guide have only scratched the surface of what Korea has to offer the world. Otherwise, I have to give them credit for producing a guide for the country AT ALL, considering that there are hardly any worth buying out that now as it is. I just recommend that for the next edition they do a little more research before publishing it."

The book is fairly thorough in that it covers most cities and towns that a western traveller would want to visit as well as some off the beaten track locations. The book covers accommodation, travel, best sights, restaurants for each of the cities and towns, and because it was revised in 2010, is fairly up to date. My main criticism is that there aren't enough photos to give a visual flavour of the country, and maps (especially for smaller towns like Gyeongju and Busan) could be better. I'd personally prefer a 'top 10 sights to see' approach to the towns with some pictorial accompaniments rather than a grey list. Also, it doesn't always explain how to get to some of the less urban places like mountain parks, e.g. Haeinsa."

There are so many books out there today that try to teach us how to live a Godly life.

Pilgrim's Progress does one thing and has been doing it very well for almost 400 years: invoking joy and hope in the heart of the reader. Reading this book is like hearing the testimony of a real brother, facing real challenges, and coming face to face with real sin. Then the power of Christ and the hope of salvation is revealed to him and suddenly, the Celestial City becomes strikingly real. This is how souls are encouraged to continue on!"

Matheson really wrote a unique story here. After you read it, you can see how it became an inspiration for much of the horror to come after it. What I really wanted to talk about however, is how it compares to the hardback/paperback version. Buyers should just beware that unlike the print edition, this version is just ""I Am Legend."" The print version contains several other short stories. However, the progress bar at the bottom still goes by the full-length book, so I was confused for some time. However, since the price is low, I don't fault anyone or subtract from the score for it. This is still a great read for anyone who loves horror with a bit of science."

The writing is top notch and the story makes it impossible to put the book down. If you like scary books, this is a MUST HAVE! By the way, it is nothing-- NOTHING-- like the movie made with its title, starring Will Smith. Hollywood changed the story and the vampires completely."
2459,1433203324,RH4B87TMZGOMY,Everything You Know About Vampires is a Lie Or: Richard Matheson and Deconstructing the Vampire Mythos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2014",,Verified Purchase,"I'll keep this brief. This book is phenomenal. I taught it for the first time this semester in a course that's in it's maiden voyage as well. Despite Matheson's comments to the contrary, this IS a multi-layered novel that can elicit many interpretations. Yes, it's a man surviving alone in a world of beings he's trying to both understand and eradicate. But like others of Matheson's works (e.g., ""Duel,"" ""Button, Button,"" ""Disappearing Act""), it hits on a beyond-literal level and contains multiple levels of meaning. And yes, it turns the vampire mythos on its ear and was notably an influence on Romero's landmark ""Night of the Living Dead."" Must-read!"

While there was a small aspect of horror with the revolving theme around vampires, there was so many more hidden aspects that made this novel a fast reading drama. Similar to a cast-a-way feel,the novel does not so much focus on the battle between man and monster,but the struggle of coping with loneliness and the idea of possibly being the last human alive."

I read a lot, but had not heard of the book before the movie came out.  The movie was okay, so my thinking was that the book would be 1000xs better. It's better,  but it's also completely different from the movie.  Not a bad read, but I was totally surprised."

Neither were treated as the buffoons they have sometimes been made to appear in film and TV. Dr. Watson's voice was effective, and he had the compassion one should expect from a physician. We also got to see a little of Mary Marston Watson. which was touching. Horowitz had his best touch with Watson. Not so much with Sherlock or Mycroft Holmes, both of whom seemed less rational and more, in Sherlock's case, maudlin, and in Mycroft's case, petulant. Furthermore, Sherlock Holmes seemed to play an odd, second-fiddle to Watson."

While I wasn't as smart as Holmes, it was close. I guess I expected something more challenging. Besides what seems like obvious outcomes, even for me (i.e. I don't like to try to solve the ending, I like the ride), I did find the reader and the writing/stories entertaining.

In Rooms, every time Micah made a decision, he saw the results.  Some decisions he made irretrievably changed his life; some decisions he could correct and have different resolutions.  Rooms is a fantasy story, but it makes you think deeply.  This would be a great book for a Bible study on the presence of God.  I am really looking forward to the next books by this author."

The first being that the illustrations (which were well done) seemed to be situated haphazardly. The Scripture references were sometimes placed in the middle of the sentence (and were often a repeat of what the character had just said). I think it would have been better as a footnote.

The lead story I am Legend is a great tale that breaks down what could be the hard science of vampirism.

This is the first of his novels I've read and it definitely will not be the last. Though written in 1954 it doesn't feel dated at all. The story is well-paced, thoughtfully written, and easy to follow. I really enjoyed Matheson's writing style. The ending is superb; thoughtful and appropriate. It's no wonder this book is a modern classic. I can't recommend it enough."

There are ten short stories after I Am Legend, half of which I gave one or two stars to. I gave the other short stories four or five stars. I Am Legend has been made into at least three movies that I know of. The Omega Man (1971) is my favorite version. The first movie, The Last Man on Earth (1964) had zombies that were too weak and slow moving to be believable and I Am Legend (2007) had zombies that were too strong and fast to be believable. They could crawl on ceilings like bugs, which was so unbelievable I laughed."

A close second would be ""The Homega Man"" episode of The Simpsons.  This is one of the many cornerstones of 20th Century horror which Matheson is responsible for.  The story is a character study of Robert Neville--the last human being in a world entirely populated by vampires--and all of the existential implications that entails.

Let me clear things up.  The guy who said you can't delete books from the nook is TOTALLY wrong.  In your library, all you have to do is double tap the book and hit archive.  And to people who say it can't do as many things as it should, it's an EREADER.  eREADERS are for reading.  If you want to listen to music, get an iPod.  Last time I checked iPod shuffles are like 50 dollars.  Trust me, I'm a musician and i love music too, but the nook without music is fine.  The same thing goes for games.  You get an ereader to read, not to play games.  iPads, iPhones, and iPod touches a great for games.  I have a nook and an ipod, an im surviving.

Rarely have I ever seen any kind of modern adaption that gives these original stories justice. The writing style is superb, the puzzles nearly impossible to solve before Holmes, a masterpiece of classic literature. Even if you have never read a Sherlock Holmes book and enjoy mystery novels, give it a try, definitely the best I've ever read. This is not a definitive collection, rather a collection of the most popular Holmes mysteries."

The daughter's story had no purpose except as an avenue to tell her mother's story, so, needles to say, the characters in her life were irrelevant, annoying, pointless.  The mother's story was somewhat predictable, not too surprising. I felt like I was constantly reading about changing buses or walking routes to avoid being followed or Eva and Romers love trysts.  It would have been interesting to find out more about Romer, how he came into his normal, upperclass life after killing everyone else and the war was over.  After all the killing he did, for him to kill himself in the end was too simple a way to end the book, a let down.  The description/write-up of the book was much more exciting than the book itself."

I felt it was one classic I should not give up on, however, so when I saw the modern version listed I gave e it another go and am satisfied having read it through.  I am a true believer, and felt that some Biblical truths were stretched and even amiss, but overall was provoked and pricked by the simple faith examples that apply to my own relationship with the Lord.  I believe that anyone of faith who reads this, simple though they may find the text, will find themselves pondering how they stand within their own pilgrimage to the heavenly shore."

It is hard to believe that it was written over 300 years ago. Modern Christian writers sometimes have the tendency to make the journey to ""The Celestial City"" to be easier than it really is. There is so much more to being a Christian than just the initial moment of the realization of Christ's salvation, the trail is sometimes difficult but the journey is worth it."

Many horror/thriller/spooky movies & TV episodes have borrowed his creepy ideas.  I Am Legend is very good, better than the 3 or 4 movies based on it in my opinion.  Just remember, half the book is I Am Legend, half the book is weird short stories, and there's basically no transition between the two, so if you're not looking for it it can be confusing : )"

That's the good part. It jumps right into the story with Neville isolated in a last-man-on-earth setting, able only to go outside during the day as factions of ""living"" and ""dead"" vampires prowl the night. There really are hardly any dull parts. There's one short chapter just of his thoughts that doesn't do much, but that's about the only slow part. And the book introduces a good amount of mystery as Neville tries to sort through the false parts of vampire legend versus the bacterial infection in the blood causing his current plight."

My first experience with a nook was the Nook First-Edition which I owned for three years.

It has been great - I appreciate that it is inexpensive, light-weight, durable, and easy to use.  I also appreciate how long it can go between charges, which is wonderful when electricity is not a certainty.  I have one observation for those considering its use in the tropics.  I was reading before going to sleep when all of my bunkmates turned off their lights.  As a result, the glowlight was the only source of illumination in the room.  This immediately attracted insects and the larger ones, such as the moths, were capable of turning the virtual pages by walking horizontally across the screen.  Then, one hit the screen so hard that it highlighted a word.  Another moth completed the next command and much to my astonishment, the definition of the word appeared on the screen.  Since it was impossible to continue reading, I turned off the glowlight and moved on to a more sedentary activity!"

I finally decided to take the chance and purchased the Nook Glowlight.  I've had it for three weeks now and so far so good - though there is a little tiny pin hole on the screen.  I had asked the customer service person at BN about the problem and she said it was just a bad batch early on and the problem was fixed.  We'll see.  I did purchase the extended warranty just in case and figured if the screen does fail I'll just give up and use a clip on light.  I like the Nook.  I like the size, the feel and the page turn buttons.  I really hope this device holds up.  It deserves to have a good following - but BN needs to step up and commit to solving whatever is wrong.

And unlike the most negative commentor, nothing is perfect, including opinions concerning the editing and length of a book. As one who favors more editing rather than less usually, my determination is that the editing is fine. I don't detect much ""filler"".  What is particularly unique about this book, is that the main characters are both females, a mother and daughter. Most of us, myself included, think of the intellegence business a a male profession. Hopefully, my view that women are the more compasionate and thoughtful regarding their lives, the story is primarily about what happens to those who do their duty, and have to live with it, the rest of their lives. As a combat pilot in Viet Nam, I willl live with my actions, loss of comrades, and the innocents I may have killed the rest of my life. Its akin to Post Traumatic Syndome, a word I did not know existed until recently. People who engage in activities that require dedication and in particular, human activities outside the norm represent a minority of the population.  I think the author touches on the subject of life after that period outside the normal existence, and living, or attempting to live a normal life. In this novel, which is placed inside the real historical world of events, most of the public is not aware, the author has written both a history of the individual being there."

It is also a compelling thriller, an intricate spy novel, and a fascinating work of historical fiction that uncovers little-known and embarrassing realities about the true relationship between Great Britain and the United States in the years immediately preceding the latter's entry into World War II. Don't pick up this book if you are looking for a genre-type spy novel. This is definitely not that type of book. This is an historically based literary novel concerning British espionage against the United States in three years leading up to Pearl Harbor.  If that appeals to you, you won't be disappointed.

Think John LeCarre and Graham Greene, not Robert Ludlum and Ken Follet.  With the spy novel, you have the ever-so-slow peeling of layers, deeper characterizaion, a frequent sense of foreboding and, until all is revealed, some confusion.  The thriller, in contrast, is the page-turning, up-all-night, action-packed adventure that you can't put down.  After finishing a thriller, you are likely to say ""where can I get another fix,"" but not to reflect on what you have just read, and if you try, you may not remember and, if you do, it may not make sense.  With the spy novel, you may want to wait a while before reading another, but you will spend some time reflecting on what you've just read, and it provokes you in a more serious, literary way."

2721,1622452399,R2CVM0U8GXNY5B,This is a classic must-read Christian book,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2016",6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"In this allegorical classic, Christian, who is the pilgrim, represents all that the author considers good Christians. He reads the Bible, the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, and feels that he is carrying a very heavy burden, and he seeks a way to unburden himself of this burden. He is encouraged by an evangelist to go to Mount Zion, and is promised that if he arrives he will be unburdened. The evangelist points out a gate and suggests that he go through that gate. Although his family, wife and children, beg him to stay, he covers his ears and leaves them. Neighbors try to dissuade him from his journey, but he rejects their advice. He is led by a secular man to Mount Sinai and this man tries to persuade him to ascend Mount Sinai and find at its top legality and morality, but the evangelical man returns and warns him that those who follow the way of Mount Sinai are “cursed.” Christian faces many difficulties, which the author Bunyan allegorically describes as the difficulties that Christians face on earth. For example, even as he reaches the gate, he is pulled through quickly and told that Beelzebub and his crew hurl missiles at those who try to enter the gate to stop them from doing so. He is then told to follow the straight path and not swerve to the right or left, to enticing by-paths. He is also told that he will have to bear the load on his back until he comes to “the place of Deliverance for there it will fall from your back of its own accord.” On his way, he meets the Interpreter who teaches him that he must despise everything in this world. He emphasizes again that the law “defiled” man: “when the commandment came, sin revived.” So begins the journey of Christian."

When the town of Staunton was mentioned early on, I figured that must have been a slip. Indeed, however, Staunton may have been the town's name as early as 1747. The names ring true with historical record and one of the most important facets of historic fiction or historic nonfiction is erasing all history that has happened since the time period being recorded. There is no anachronism here. I understand the author died in 2004, but she should be applauded for her attention to historic record in this novel."

Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook.

The first day I spent registering it, learning how to access the features, accessing our Wi-Fi, etc. Only after I learned how to turn on the GlowLight did I realize it had a defective display screen and obviously I needed to return it. After calling their customer service, then attempting to explain the problem to a woman who, I assume, understood me better than I understood her, she agreed that I needed it replaced. This phone call seemed to go on for an hour or so, with my trying to understand what she was telling me about their detailed instructions for returns and replacements by mail. In frustration, I finally asked if I couldn't simply return it to their store. After checking, she said they didn't have any in stock."
2771,1400501717,RQFSZ75XDIM07,Great!...for a while,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2014",,,"I have had my Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight for two years now. It really is great, and has a super lightweight feel to it. I love the simplicity of it and the backlight has made a huge difference than a regular e reader with no light. However, the screen is EXTREMELY delicate. I had my Nook for less than a month when I dropped a pen on the screen accidentally, and a nick in the screen was left behind. It seems like the simplest of dings screw up the screen, and it becomes very distracting when there is a bright light leaking out of a nick in the screen. However, as long as you are careful with it, it shouldn't be a problem. I'm not rough with my Nook in any way (I have used my leather case for it since I bought the Nook and have never taken it off), but I am clumsy and that could be why I have screen damage. Another thing is after two years, my Nook is INCREDIBLY slow and glitchy. Mind you, I have only bought about twenty books on here and yet it still freezes or an error message appears almost every time I try to shop for a new book. The Nook also freezes often on the book I am reading, and I have to force it to restart (if it doesn't restart on its own which also happens occasionally). All in all this Nook is super functional and great, but apparently two years is it's lifespan. It's a good e reader for beginners or even those who aren't familiar or aren't looking for complex technology. However, you do get what you pay for in this instance and this Nook definitely is not built to last or have a memory capacity like the newer models of e readers. It's a great buy and is not a money pit like some reviews would have you believe, but if you are looking for a durable e reader that you won't have to replace for a good while definitely dish out the extra cash and invest in the Nook HD or even a Kindle Fire."

Should this break I will purchase another e reader from Barnes and Noble.  I have owned several of the nook e readers. I own the nook simple touch and nook color as well as the kindle keyboard.  I also  previously owned the original nook but  passed on to my sister when I received this one two years ago.  I have had none of the issues with the screen as other users but don't use the glowlight all that much except when traveling out of town.  All in all I like Barnes and Nobles e readers better than kindle and use my Nook the most. I find Barnes and Noble makes more solid and study e readers and tablets.  I mostly download free auio books from my local library and this works out well for me. A super e reader that does what it's supposed to and does it very well.

I wanted it mainly because there was a light and I would not have to use an external light source because I like to read in bed. The nook is the perfect size, the light can be adjusted to your desired brightness, as well as the size of the words on the page. Setting the nook up and adding books to it is very easy. I owned an ipad before and I hated adding books to it because itunes is just a big pain. Like Amazon's kindle, you simple drag and drop your ebook or download via wifi from the actual e-reader. The one thing that the nook glowlight has over the kindle is the price, which is another reason I chose it over the kindle when getting a replacement."

I currently have an iPad mini, so I have the Nook and Kindle reading apps for that. But I have to say that I most enjoy the reading experience on my Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight. My iPad is nice, but honestly I'm on a computer all day at work so my eyes tend to get tired a lot quicker looking at another computer screen, for all intensive purposes. The Nook is much easier on the eyes, and I love how light it is to hold! I do not have mine in a case when I am reading, I bought a padded zippered pouch like holder for when it is not in use and it works well for protecting it while traveling.  I love the feel of the naked Nook. The curved back and rounded corners give it a very organic book like feel. The rubberized texture of the back gives it a nice feel too.  Sometimes I almost forget I'm not reading a real book!  The built in light is great, especially for those nights when my husband is ready to go to sleep and I want to read 'just a little bit longer.'  The light doesn't bother him at all and it's perfect for me to read in the dark. It's nice to be able to do so without the clunky clip on book lights of the past."

What innovation, what a set of unique properties.  (Sarcasm off).  Yeah the physical aspects of the Nook are OK, as are most other readers.  What it does lack is any efficient way of organizing the books.  The software interface is incredibly awkward and clunky.  I thought the Sony inteface was bad, but at least you could manipulate books on the computer quickly and easily, and then sync that with the reader.  I don't need a device that is 1/2 oz lighter or a tenth of an inch thinner.  I need one which has a useful gui interface."

There have been books that will stand the test of time (New Confessions) and ones that already seem dated (Stars and Bars), but Restless finds him in good form.  Boyd, as flexible as ever, turns his attention to the spy genre.  We are presented with a double narrative, mother and daughter.  The plot is hampered by a slightly overwrought literary device, the mother doling out her diaries at intervals, conveniently allowing the author to flip back and forth in time.  Still, Boyd remains a wonderful writer.  His characters are incisive, full blooded and captivating, even the ones we're not supposed to like.  Boyd, like McEwan, manages the perfect blend of literature and thriller and Restless reads very quickly.  That alone is a reason to buy it, but add in the Paris of 1939, spymasters and double dealings and Boyd is on to another winner."

I see that some reviewers have complained that most of the characters are one-dimensional; I believe that was deliberate, to make the main character stand out in higher relief. I enjoyed the device of the diary, peeling back the past a bit at a time, leaving the reader eager for the next installment. I also found that knowing in advance that Eva survived her adventures in WWII did not noticeably lessen the tension for me when her memoirs revealed times of danger; I still was on edge to see HOW she survived."

Ruth Gilmartin is a late-twenties single mother and tutor at Oxford in 1976 who has a somewhat prickly relationship with her aging but still very sharp widowed mother, Sally. Then one day Sally tells her daughter her real name is Eva Delectorskaya and that she was a Russian émigré recruited by the British Secret Service in 1939. Ruth has doubts about her mother's mental state but the vividness of her extremely detailed memoir -- passed to Ruth episodically -- convinces her. The thing is, Sally is sure someone is planning to kill her. The chapters alternate between Sally/Eva's third-person narrative and Ruth's quiet life teaching English to foreign engineers and businessmen, with Eva doing things as a yong woman in pre-Pearl Harbor Europe and the U.S. that her daughter -- now about the same age -- can hardly believe. Both women are fully three-dimensional, and so is Lucas Romer, the spymaster with his own agenda, with whom Eva fell in love. Boyd also does a terrific job elucidating the propaganda war Britain fought to try to get America into the war, planting false news stories and disinformation to sway public opinion. James Bond this ain't. A remarkable and riveting book with an extremely realistic non-Hollywood ending."

It is the premise of the story that gives it such zip, in addition to fine writing by the author.  Think of a situation where it turns out your own mother is entirely a different person, that is has a different background, that you had been led to believe by her, and in fact she had been a spy before and during World War II. Add to this her fears that she is in danger after all these  years (the novel is set in 1976) and this leads her to ""come clean"" with you.  More I will not reveal but it is, at points, a real ""page turner.""  The book shifts back and forth between the mother's spy career and the present day activities of her daughter--and this does tend to slow things down a bit.  Also there are some superfluous subplots involving the daughter which also dilute the action sequences on occasion.  Nonetheless, there are stretches where the book is simply gripping and one becomes entirely engrossed in it.  A highly unique premise and a most stimulating story."

With his past work he's shown himself to be a writer at ease in multiple locations and time frames, and here he plays to that strength with a narrative moving back and forth between 1939 Paris and 1976 England. The story starts in the latter, where single mother Ruth Gilmartin is given a rather shocking manuscript by her aging, Cotswold village-dwelling mother, Sally. It's a well-worn adage that we can never truly know our parents, and Ruth is given prime evidence of this, as her mother's manuscript reveals her true identity. The sharp, white-haired, garden-tending widow grew up as a White Russian émigré in Paris, and was recruited into the British Secret Service in 1939."

This reminds me of Graham Greene's ""The Human Factor"".  Not a crackling, action packed spy thriller but one that keeps one transfixed nonetheless.

The characters are multi-dimensional yet not overly exposed; there's still room for the reader to to read into the character what one chooses."

Already read four books on it and it reads just as easy as a paper book. Battery lasted only three weeks instead of two months (but depends on the amount of pages you turn, and I turned quite a lot of them ;p), but the battery is charged within three or four hours,so no big deal. Nice, light weighted, compact e-reader, with good screen and enough options to change font,font size, etc. Also very quick delivery to Europe with Amazon (within a week!). Good price vs. quality. For Europeans, don't buy the extra adapter, because it's American only and it's easy to charge via pc. If you're looking for an alternative to paper books, this is a great device. I also bought a NOOK cover from B&N: very pretty, but a little expensive I think, the back crinkles very quick and it takes a while to ship to Europe."

Before going, cut the coupons for the Free slot play, Match Play and any others that look interesting. One day of our trip is coupon day. We use the GPS we brought on the trip and scoot from casino to casino using the above valuable coupons at the slots/crap table or blackjack table. We go in, get a players card, for a $10 match play coupon, buy $10 in chips, place the coupon and the $10 in chips on the table and if we win we get back our $10 chips plus $20 more. Our last trip in July 2010 we won far more than we lost on these coupons. It was fun visiting a lot of different casinos and seeing a lot of Vegas. These coupons more than pay for the cost of the guide and once you do what I've described you may also make this a tradition on your trips to Vegas.....Note, the coupons are good once per year per casino; you can't go twice during a 12 month period and use the same coupon at that casino from another American Casino Guide. Besides the coupons, the guide has a lot of info on the various games, casinos, points of interest ect..... Buy it well before your trip and read it. Plan your trip and enjoy."

It eventually went to her mother, leaving my wife without an ebook.  I looked and looked and looked trying to find something comparable but could not find anything.  That was until I ran across the Nook Simple.  The Nook Simple had external storage, meaning I could expand it's storage with an sdcard, it was compatible with several of the formats that are popular and in use almost everywhere (epub, pdf, txt, etc.).  But the real deal maker was when I found the Nook Simple with the Glowlight option.  This is an amazing feature that provides just the right amount of light for you to read by, whether you are laying in bed at night, sitting in a car in the middle of the day and anywhere in between.  You can adjust the brightness from just a hint of light (good for reading late at night) up to somewhere close to a mini sun behind the text."

Five years and what, seventy tries online and the site defaulted t my old address. Called customer service. ""Oh I am correcting that right this minute"" a young man said as I could hear keyboard strokes over the phone. Two weeks later they shipped a replacement to the old address. They want a hundred dollars for a gizmo that costs as much as some basic smart phones. And it breaks. The phones are still working, taking images, playing music but the NOOK cannot display print and chew gum at the same time. Don't even bother going to the B&N site for book reviews. It is a drop box for drug dealer messages. Barnes and Noble is setting themselves up for a Chapter 13."

This story is far more realistic and therefore darker, better. Despite the fact that it was written in the fifties, it explains many dogmata of the vampire genre in a very plausible way.

2866,1433203324,RLXXMSFYFLM40,And they died unhappily ever after,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"So this is about the 10th ""last man on earth"" (its always a man isn't it, funny) novel that I have read, and I would have to say this is one of the best one so far.  I went into this novel having seen the Will Smith movie, and not liking it so much.  I think the deal is this:  If you like the movie, you won't like the book, and vice versa.  I wondered how I would like a novel where the human race has be destroyed by vampires, rather than zombies, nuclear war, or plague, but I would have to say, I think that for the context of this novel, it matters not at all how the human race was extinguished, it just was, and was replaced with vampire-like beings.  The book reminded me a lot of 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, in that the main focus of the novel is this how this last man deals with being alone on earth with little or no companionship.  The book is a touch dated because it was written in the 60's, the vampires are a bit cliched and his views on women and sex are almost funny at times (for example, the female vampires try to lure him out of his house by being naked, and he sits inside and pounds his fist to the walls and drinks and can't look outside for fear of being lured out of the house for cheap sex).  What I really liked about this novel, and why I gave it 5 instead of 4 stars, is it deals with so much, in so little space, its not a long novel, but it has a lot of depth, and its very accessible.  The main character is your typical every day normal guy (I don't think it even said what he did before, other than ""he worked at a plant"", I assume nuclear power plant?  So he is Homer Simpson then?).  I'm sure you could sit down and pick this novel apart for its cliches and silly vampireisms, but in the end, you turn quickly from page to page, desperately wanting something to go right for this guy, and of course, you know it can't.  He is the last human alive, surrounded by vampires, alone.  Simply put.  He is Legend."

A man, Robert Neville, imperfect, realistic and brave in the face of overwhelming circumstances, refuses to abandon hope even though he recognizes the very real possibility that he may be the last of his kind. Neville's desperate grasping at one last hope leads to an unexpected and provocative ending, leaving the reader with a glimpse of primal imperatives rarely sensed in literature attuned to modern, sophisticated sensitivities. It is a reminder that the word, sophisticated, is derived from the same root as sophistry."

Some sections were quite riveting some quite dull.

The device is brilliant.  You want to read straight forward and mundane, well, stick to Ludlum or Silva or whomever.  The discerning reader will note the author's subtlety and craft.  His slight of hand if you will.  The slow way the substance of the tale is revealed.  It's like being lost in a forest.  You believe you know which path to take out.  The sun is shining.  You come upon a meadow here, a brook there.  No, wrong way.  It is only when all is revealed and you are safely out that you say, well, I knew where I was all the time.  But, you didn't.  Boyd never disappoints.  I stumbled upon him long ago when I read The Ice Cream War.  His novels are all dissimilar.  He's vastly underrated because he's so accessible.

The mother-daughter storylines are somewhat imbalanced, but they have to be.  The mother's story is revealed to the daughter who has to make sense of it in the midst of her own, complicated, young adult life.  One character's narrative is completed (or is it?), while the other's is temporarily explored, midstream.  There is a satisfying conclusion for one storyline, and merely a stopping place for the other.  Somehow, these two add up to a compelling combination, like the mixed flavors of sweet and tart in a very good cherry pie.  Yum."

In the modern segment we had a young mother trying to sort out her life, and is coping with an increasingly odd-acting mother who announces that she is not who she thinks is; in fact she is a Russian-born WW II spy.  In the pre-WW II thread we see how this woman became a spy and what sort of spying she actually did.  Both narrative threads blend together beautifully; the book is immensely readable.  It all comes together with a satisfying conclusion."

The author blended history and present moments really well. Most books I have read that jump back and forth through time is confusing but I looked forward to the contrast between the mothers life and the daughters current one. Each detail of the mothers life as a spy was so given at a descent enough pace to keep me hooked until it was all laid out in front of me.The two stories he told blended quite well. It has always amazed me what parents were willing to do and did to protect their country and most of the time the children never knew the extent of the sacrifice that was made. The author gave good details without overwhelming the story and by the end the daughters character had actually matured by the things she learned about her mother. Because the story was being told from the daughters point of view and the mothers story as secondary it keeps your focus on the present day. Neither character overwhelms the story line. I would reccomend this book to any one who wants a quick lesson in WWII espionage and how it still affects the people involved to this day. The war has not ended for those individuals and won't til the day they die. It is definitely going on my read again shelf. The only aspect that was not needed was the information on the main characters ex and his brother. There was really no conclusion to their story line and I had to wonder why he included them. I would have liked to see more information or a followup to the characters.

The rest of the story had such character that was not present in the closing.

There are over 300 pages in the book but only the first 160 pages are I Am Legend.  After page 160 Matheson dives into about 10 or so shorter stories which have nothing to do with the main title of the book.  I enjoyed I Am Legend and I found the short stories amusing but I found it kind of disappointing that I thought I payed for a full book about I Am Legend.  I feel a little cheated considering the cover and the back of the book give no indication that the story only lasts for half the book.  I would recommend to buy but just understand that the whole book has more than the main story.

Also I've watched ever film version of this story from Vincent price to Will Smith and never was that impressed. Finally I got around to reading this and my word was I shocked. Not only was it a much scarier than any movie version it was much more complex in the way it made you feel. It was as if you were there with Neville as an observer.

I will just set up the account so it will not charge my credit card if the gift card balance goes to low.  Guess what - YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!  You can password protect the device for purchases - which will keep someone else from purchasing if you lose it; but that same password allows access to the credit card on file if you don't have enough of a balance on the gift card.

It could get very costly if you had to take public transportation or taxis. We have found that one of the best buffets in Las Vegas is the Saturday or Sunday Brunch at the Silverton where you have a buy one get one coupon.  In two words, buy it!!"

There are many coupons in here.  We did not use that many but I still felt it was worth it.  The problem is that many of the free play coupons are for new sign ups and I already have player cards at most of the casinos.  We did like the coupon for the Rio buffet and if you don't have a Venetian player card that coupon is great.  Many of the coupons are for off strip so be aware of that.

Utilizing mind-twisting conflicts and heart-wrenching loss throughout the story, the author illustrates in a profound way how often to gain what we need we must first abandon what we thought we'd always wanted. Taking it one step further, it made me think in a completely new way about how 1 Corinthians, Chapter 13 states that ""without love, I am nothing"" (paraphrased by me to illustrate this point)."

Holmes outwitted his opponents. He used his brain. He created the concept of a detective as a methodical, tenacious stalker. So, if you've never read through the original works, you should make the time. You'll see that Holmes is not just brilliant, but also solitary, and a drug abuser (cocaine). Doyle was making him human. Enjoy these wonderful tales."

There is the story of Eva Delektorskaya, who had been recruited into the British Secret Service just before the outbreak of the Second World War.  She was very good  at her work;  but for much of the time the bigger picture is kept from her by her boss, and that picture includes the deadly rivalries within and between the various intelligence agencies.  When she realizes that as part of that game someone has tried to have her killed, she escapes from the outfit and adopts a new identity in England, of which the man who would become her husband and her daughter Ruth are kept in total ignorance.  But in 1976 she thinks she has reason to suspect that whoever wanted her dead in 1941 is still after her;  and she has to recruit Ruth to help her fend off the danger.  In order to do this, she has first to tell her story to Ruth, and she does this by sending her in instalments the story of her previous life.  I found it an unsatisfactory and unconvincing device: it reads like chapters in a novel that she had already written: it is a third-person narrative and there is far too much novelistic detail in the script for it to have been written for the purpose of putting Ruth into the picture.  On the other hand, if the account had already been written, why was it not handed over to Ruth all together, instead of being released to her in sections alternating with the first person narrative of Ruth's life after she is first told that her mother's life might be in danger?"

That said, its the weakest Boyd I've ever read. This time his portrayal of real life characters in interesting times and extraordinary circumstances falls flat. I found it very hard to care even a bit for the daughter's story. I found it only a little harder to care for the mother's pretty-girl-turned-murderous-spy plot. Even the wartime situations the mother is involved in and that lead up to the climax of the novel are very far from enthralling. Its almost as if this is a novel without protagonists, since the protagnists themselves and the plot around them is so uninteresting. Emphasizing all this are the surrounding characters (ie the Iranian english student, the estranged german father of Jochen, his brother and Ilse) who not only add nothing to the plot but provide no really interesting subplots of their own (actually, to the contrary)."

The setting is the 1970s but much is told in flashbacks to the second world war time period. I found it difficult to put this book down; it was a fascinating read and and illuminated me about an oft overlooked facet of the USA's decision to actively join the allied forces. Mr. Boyd's knack for infusing humor and the most basic level of candor in his stories is quite present throughout.

It has worked well, with no problems.  Both Nooks get a little glitchy, I've noticed, when the charge starts getting low.  I will also say that it's my impression that downloading from libraries is still relatively new process; haven't tried it yet myself, and not all libraries even offer the service.  I don't object to the ads; they are not intrusive, and I just don't look at them if I'm not up for it.  However, as with all e-readers, realize that e-books are no bargain, most of the time. Most of the books I've read cost about 10 dollars.  I've downloaded free books from Google e-books that would otherwise have cost a small fortune.  It's nice not to have to find a home for a book that I've read but don't want to keep.  With this product, the advantages are that it is lightweight, you can increase/change the font and size, which is a huge advantage if you have vision issues, you don't accumulate physical books that you don't want to keep, and the Glowlight at night is fantastic when you want to read when your partner is ready for lights out.  I had a clip-on light with the original Simple Touch and it was inconvenient as far as placement, glare, etc.  We have a Kindle e-reader as well, and I much prefer the touchscreen on the Nook to the buttons on the Kindle for page turning."

I was especially let down by Michael Dirda, a member of the Baker Street Irregulars and a respected writer and critic.  His review of ""The House of Silk"" in ""The Washington Post"" prompted me to get the book.  He praised ""Horowitz's skill in . . . mimicking . . . the style and tone of Arthur Conan Doyle.""  I must respectfully disagree with his assessment.  Horowitz's first few sentences reminded me of Mark Twain's comment on his wife's attempts at swearing: she had the words, but she didn't have the tune.  Mr. Horowitz has the words, but the tune is not Doyle/Watson, and the words actually aren't quite right.  Horowitz is prolix, whereas Doyle, Dirda himself says in his book ""On Conan Doyle,"" was ""unrivaled for crisp, narrative economy.""  In addition, when Horowitz/Doyle morphed into Horowitz/Dickens to comment on social conditions in Victorian England, I almost discarded the book.  There is no question that the conditions existed, but they were not part of the London evoked by Doyle for Holmes and do not belong in a novel purporting to be about his and Watson's adventures."

I don’t give spoilers but this plot is very original and actually fascinating in its uniqueness.  Definitely worth reading. I deducted one star because of a major error in the book. I don’t want to give anything away but it involved 2 sneaking scenes on the same night in a castle. The author used the exact same wording for both. That kinda ruined the flow for me."

However, the double plot line was the clincher that set it apart. I will not spoil the book, but there are several things happening at the same time, each of which added to my experience. The wording was perfect for the story, although, grammar Nazis might not agree.  Every character was well developed, and the scenes were described in vivid detail. I read the prequel to this book ""Warbringer"" and simply had to continue. Witches, Warlocks, Knights, goblins, ogres, bloody battles, and love stories all mixed appealingly. I will definitely read the next! Five stars to Mr. Morin."

Interesting concepts and a well-woven story. It took a bit to figure out the players and their relationships but this was a hard book to put down from then on. I read a lot before bedtime and the thought that someone was waiting for me to sleep so they might see and experience what I had done that day just wouldn't leave my mind. It never will. When an author can change your perspective like that it's a powerful thing. Excuse me now but I am loading up the 2nd book to continue the story. Sweet dreams!

The quality of the writing is superb, and espionage fans will especially enjoy the intriguing story it details.  The characters are thoroughly developed, and the locations are nicely evoked, especially, I'm sure, for readers who've had the fortune to visit them on their own.  I found the ending of the story especially strong, perhaps because it was as well done as all that preceded it -- not just a perfunctory tying up of loose ends or a bloody shootout."

So it is with Restless. Eva's story is just more engaging and evocative than her daughter's. The strands tie up cleverly at the end but personally I'd have been happy to have read a full 300 pages set during the war.

Though this is my first William Boyd book, I'm an espionage novel aficionado and found this book first-rate. Fleshed out characters. Seems plausible. Well-plotted.

I'm not sure why. I think it's because I just couldn't care enough about the characters. They all seemed to be adrift morally or spiritually. The little boy wasn't depicted very well. I did like the ending, though, and was glad I didn't quit when I was close to the end. I wouldn't have minded had I quit before I was half done or maybe even 2/3 done, though."

Alternating between WWII and recent modern Britain, Restless is the stories of 2 women, a mother and daughter.  The mother turns out to have had a hidden history as a spy during WWII which may be coming back to haunt her.  The daughter is at a crossroads in her personal and professional lives.  The story of the mother dominates the book.  A weakness of the book is that the daughter's story seems almost like a accretion, not adding much more than window dressing to the whole story.  Character development is fair and the basic plot mechanism, revealed in a somewhat clunky fashion at the end, is far-fetched."

When I saw that the trailer for the soon to be released movie I knew that if I saw the movie first then I'd never read the book.  I ordered the copy from Amazon that had the coolest cover and read it when it arrived on Wednesday.  First off, I'll be surprised if the newest movielization of this is any closer to the written story than The Last Man on Earth or Omega Man.  The story is very well-played...but I was completely bamboozled by Amazon when I Am Legend came to an end halfway through the book, and I realized that the other half of the book was a collection of short-stories.  I thought I had quite a bit of story left until I realized that the ""next chapter"" I had just begun was a completely different story.  I looked the book over, and the only indication that the whole book wasn't I Am Legend was a small phrase on the back just above the bar-code...""The complete novel, plus several more unforgettable tales.""  I can't really complain...more stories!...but I thought that it could have been a bit more apparent say...on the cover...or the spine...that I'd bought half a book of filler."

Unfortunately, the glowlight was about the only thing that worked as advertised.  Navigating by touching the screen was extraordinarily frustrating as the damn thing often simply refused to respond.  In addition, the text was not particularly crisp and seemed to vary in intensity (darkness) on the page.  It also appears that, when powered up, the device will only return to the home page and not to the page of the book being read when turned off (a feature I appreciate in the Kindle).  All in all, a big disappointment.  I'm just hoping that the retail store from whom I bought the reader will take it back."

I enjoy paranormal fantasy literature and occasionally am in the mood for inspirational Christian lit (often that genre has disappointing qualit of writing though) and was pleased to see the blending of the two.  Even though I found the book extremely predicatable and somewhat too long (much was repetitive and could have been cut) it was written so well that I enjoyed relaxing and enjoying the slow pace of the story.  This is not a book to read if you want a fast paced read.  However, if you are willing to be patient and enjoy watching the slow evolution of a changing heart and self discovery with a hint of a supernatural mystery, then you will enjoy this read."

Those that are written for men, at least those that aren't written by Ted Dekker, aren't stories that interest me.  James Rubart not only touches on the supernatural, but engages your imagination while remaining true to the bible.  The house in ROOMS is not some magic house like I've seen in other reviews.  To me, the house in ROOMS is reflective of his own soul.  The ""voice"" of the house was his own, albeit before he came to know the Lord.  The house changes as his soul changes.  So does the voice of the house.  What happens to him and how he reacts is the lesson that this book teaches us.  The bible tells us that the Lord is preparing a house for us in Heaven.  Preparing is a present tense word.  It changes by the day.  What is the state of your soul?  What will your house in Heaven look like?  Read this book and gain a better understanding of the Spirit inside you while being entertained at the same time."

By popular demand, Doyle revived the Holmes character ten years later with the somewhat puzzling explanation that only the evil Moriarty was actually killed. Doyle continued to write Sherlock Holmes stories for another 24 years and his last Holmes mystery was published three years before his death in 1930. Doyle tried hard to distance himself from his Holmes creation to write ""serious"" literature and ironically 80 years after his death, the Sherlock Holmes mysteries turn out to be Doyle's sole ticket to literary immortality."

I thought it was pretty bad. The word hurler did it for me (""Gotta hurl, Dude""). And the cover was not too appealing either.  Is this a representation of the author? A scruffy guy in armor is still a scruffy guy.  But the reviews were good, and the summary sounded interesting, so I gave it a try and to my surprise it was pretty good. There are some good plot elements, very interesting action, and the writing doesn't get in the way. I think most people will like this, but I was somewhat disappointed. It seems more like a fantasy for guys. I read the whole thing, though I did skim through some of the parts with the murdering pirate. When I got to the end there wasn't a feeling of satisfaction and I felt like I really didn't care to read anymore about these characters. I guess what it came down to is that there wasn't a single character that I admired or cared about or wanted to spend more time with. They were all a little morally ambivalent and shallow. In a really addictive story the author makes you care about the character; either he's greatly downtrodden, or he has a great passion or hunger, or a strong love and strong ideals. The character needs to care, and you need to care, or the story doesn't matter as much. I'm not saying these characters don't care at all, but I couldn't get engaged with any of them. SPOILER ALERT  I despised the pirate character, and his revenge-thirsty ""twin"" and wished for less writing about them. The scribe dude was a bit wishy-washy. We leave him stranded on a tropical island with a bevy of island beauties, and he's not upset at all at being abandoned there. Guy fantasy. If I were in his situation, I would have been furious first, with fantasies of fire-bombing the pirate's ship; then I would have been anxious (would I ever see my beloved again or before I was old? Would I find a reliable ship someday? Where would I go then?), and then I would make the best of it and try to be hopeful. HE just blithely accepts it from the beginning.  The protagonists seem pretty content to just go with the flow and they don't think about it much. I was more hopeful for the knight, although how he could save the story while carrying his albatross of a twin was a puzzle. He's intelligent, a loyal soldier and friend, and risks his life to save others. Admirable.  But his relationships never were developed well. You know he cares about his friend, but he doesn't think about him, or talk to him, much. He sort of loves this girl who has been re-betrothed to his friend, and he's sort  upset about it, but really pragmatic more than passionate. He doesn't agonize over it enough to convince me he really cares. When you truly want something (or someone) you can't have, you are desperately trying to think of a way to make it happen. If you can let it go that easily, then it's just a minor disappointment. The other two main characters, the sorcerer-demon and his son, were also underdeveloped emotionally. I guess what was really lacking was strong feeling and relationships, but also a better understanding of the characters' motivations (i.e. what do they want and why do they want it). Nobody really loves anybody all that much, or it's not explained in a way that makes me feel it. The characters are interesting but need more heart. The story is very good otherwise and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes popular, but for me, it wasn't entertaining enough to make up for that."
3209,1939233011,R3VKRUGEV0Z7X9,different spin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2014",,Verified Purchase,I liked this book a lot.  I only have a few fantasy writers that I follow like Terry Brooks and Tad Williams but this book held my interest and I look forward to the next one.  The idea of the characters dreaming each other's lives was a different spin and an interesting one.  The author occasionally got bogged down in geography and the ease with which one of the characters accepted his accidental killing of dozens of innocent people was a little disconcerting but all in all a an entertaining book.

It's a LONG book and I read it on my Kindle.  I never lost interest.  Many characters are well developed in this first book.  The author creates a two-dimensional world where Kyros and Brannis are twins (but different eras) as well as Tendak and Jinzan (twins characters in two different eras).  One is the sorcerer / good knight and the other the bad pirate / sorceror.  I'm eager to read the next book in the series.

It has a unique twist on classical fantasy that left me enthralled for two days. I couldn't put this book down (I actually failed a test because i would rather read than study). The writing isn't long or langorous; it's fast, short, and exciting. The character stories are linked together very well. 5/5 and I'll be buying the next two books for sure. So good. It' might not be high fantasy due to the writing style, but hell, it doesn't need to be. A wonderful piece perfect for a weekend read"

This was obvious in the middle of Chapter 8 and it might explain some of the other issues I had with the story. One of these was that Richard Matheson stated there was more than one type of vampire early on in the story but I found it hard to understand from Neville's point of view what the differences between them were. The story also jumps around a little and, while I've seen this in other stories, I found it harder than usual to recognize when this was happening. This might have been the result of missing text."

The story was a thrilling read and the research was apparent in the details that the author ensured was portrayed in the story.

I have become a huge fan of his work. that said this early work is weak in vocabulary and limited in its descriptions.  If there was an editor involved, a good deal of malpractice is in evidence.  Mr. Morin is a skilled author in desperate need of a literary agent, quality publisher, publishing editor, copy editor.  With support of these professionals there no room for doubt in my mind that he will stand the test of time and be co-equal to the giants of this genre (R.A. Salvatore, Margaret Weiss, etc.) and far superior to those hacks that insist on selling the watered down storytelling that is possible with a series (Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"", etc..)

Der Schreibstil von Patricia Cornell gefällt mir wirklich gut. Irgendwie wurde mir dieses Mal erst richtig bewusst, dass das Buch aus Sicht von Kay Scarpetta geschrieben ist, obwohl man auch sonst die Eindrücke der anderen Personen gut mitbekam – ganz ehrlich? Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie sie das gemacht hat, aber es hat funktioniert. Dadurch fühlt man sich, meiner Meinung nach viel mehr in die Geschichte ein. Wie schon bei den letzten Malen hat mir die Beziehung zwischen Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Benton Wesley und Pete Marino wirklich gut gefallen. Es sind alles 3 einzigartige Personen, mit so unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften und Ansichten. Und auch wenn sie es vielleicht selbst manchmal nicht so sehen, ich finde es ist eine tolle Freundschaft, die die 3 verbindet."

Part I is much different than Part II. I found Part I to be a very spiritual allegory involving Christian on his ""christian journey"" from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. The description of these places and the spiritual significance of those places as rooted in either testament of the Bible. The characterization of a solitary journeyman is what I found comforting about Part I. This can also be said about the ""eponymous"" characters he meets. Therefore, themes of alienation and social isolation are brought to the fore. And although this is in some opinions an ancient text, it translates well to current language and situations. Children can read this in smaller portions, but I think the freedom of movement may be more meaningful than the confusing moral lessons one might take from taking instruction from those it is difficult to evaluate as friend or foe. Both books can assert righteousness and sinful wayfaring on somewhat arbitrary interpretations, not too much different from the Old Testament."

Though the series gets a little prolonged towards the end, the 'twin' mechanic is interesting, though the whole 'sleeping when the other is awake' seems to get edited in the second to make it more plausible. I didn;t care for how many people had twins, and how strange it was that no one would ever talk about their twin, though it was a widely held trait."

The twist in this is that a few people share consciousness on two different worlds. They have some abilities on one world and different abilities on the other. That's cool, but as the story goes on damn near everybody is that way. The story skips all over the place, probably in an effort to stretch it out to trilogy length. It's readable, but in my view not worth $5.99. Maybe $2.99."

Ich lese es erst jetzt, kurz vor Weihnachten 2009, und bin tief beeindruckt. Es hat nichts von seiner Aktualität eingebüßt. Es ist ein Schocker, ein ""Sachbuch-Thriller"", ein Augenöffner. Und es macht Mut, dass sich friedlicher, aber beharrlicher Widerstand gegen profitgierige Feinde eines mündigen Staatsbürgertums auszahlt. Das Thema ist absolut grundlegend, weil es etwas beschreibt, das an den Grundfesten der Demokratie, unserer marktwirtschaftlichen Bürgergesellschaft rüttelt. Es ist so gut geschrieben (""brilliant"" ist nicht übertrieben), dass es ""Pflichtlektüre"" an Schulen und Universitäten werden sollte. Aber auch Eltern erfahren hier, wie sich ihre Kids von einer schier unvorstellbaren Marketingmaschinerie mit allen Finessen vereinnahmen lassen. Und betriebswirtschaftlich Interessierte lernen, wie sich Produktionskosten unter Ausnutzung internationaler Ungleichgewichte ""optimieren"" und Gewinne maximieren lassen."

We all have full control over our actions, decisions, and beliefs, and this book showed me how to gain that control.

Robert Neville is isolated for years without any outside contact as the vampire hoard lurked outside his door. The shifts in his mood between apathy, anger, depression, desperate hope, and at times seeming madness and cruelty made his character feel real and believable. The chapter about the dog was so human it was painful."

With that said, I chose this title because I had seen the movie, and was not aware that the movie was an adaptation of a book (because I don't always read the credits).  With that said, do not expect this book to be anything like the movie, the story line is actually less developed.  Unless there is a book precluding this one, much of the backstory is left to the imagination, and since the main character Robert Neville is not a research scientist on a mission like the protagonist in the movie, the focus of the story is psychological, not the action packed, CGI fueled storyline of the movie.  And because of this, the book misses plot opportunities than could give more breadth to the psychological drama that is the life of Robert Neville, and to me that equals not much of a stimulating read."

3528,1883768195,R36JQWCVRA43LJ,Good Value,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2011",,Verified Purchase,"This book is a good value for any visitor to Vegas (in particular). The book has some solid advice about many gambling games, although don't look here for winning advice on how to play poker or bets sports (two of the beatable games offered in a casino).  This advice is great for the novice gambler, but someone interested in elevating their game will need to look deeper than this book.  That said, the real reason to buy this book is the coupons.  It is not too hard to make your money back on the purchase price of this book if you use just 2 or 3 of the right coupons.  As stated earlier, however, the largest section of coupons is for Las Vegas, so it is the Las Vegas visitor who will have the easiest time recouping your investment in this book.  Look at the coupons closely to see how they fit your intended 2011 travel schedule.  It is worth noting that most of the Las Vegas coupons are for casinos away from the more popular South and Central Strip locations.  In this regard, it is highly helpful to rent a car to take advantage of all of the Las Vegas coupons.  A final, important note:  the Sahara casino will be closing in early May.  The 2011 American Casino Guide contains a $25 matchplay that will no longer be redeemable after early May, 2011.  So, don't factor that coupon into the value of the guide unless you a headed to Vegas in the next month."

When you say that an author has presented his works in an entirely new way you are probably repeating what you have stated before about another author.  Recently I read a business book written with a fictional storyline, and I stated that this was a unique way for an author to maintain your interest and here it is happening again.  John Bunyan wrote a religious book, Pilgrim's Progress, with a unique fictional storyline.  So, I'm repeating myself in saying that it's rare when an author writes about a major topic utilizing a fictional storyline; this has been going on for a long time and I'm sure will continue as long as there are writers.  John had a clever way of giving his characters their names; such as Christian, Evangelist, Honest,  etc. (Each fitting a particular situation in the story).  I felt this application added to the story and gave you little doubt as to the make up of the particular character or to their placement in the story.  I especially liked how the author would fit a specific verse or verses of the Bible within the story as a highlight or emphasis as additional explanation for the reader.  I started highlighting these while reading and found them to amount to an additional Bible study as well as an important part of the story.  I'm sure that Pilgrim's Progress was on my list of required reading in high school but I found it to be a fresh new read; maybe because of the difference in my age now, approximately 70 years older, then when I was in high school.  I recommend that you read Pilgrim's Progress with an open mind and just enjoy..."

Ils se rencontrent pour la première fois au début des années cinquante, en pleine adolescence, dans l'un des quartiers les plus huppés de Lima, Miraflores. Joyeux, inconscients, ils font partie d'une jeunesse dorée qui se passionne pour les rythmes du mambo et ne connaît d'autre souci que les chagrins d'amour. Rien ne laissait alors deviner que celle qu'on appelait à Miraflores «la petite Chilienne» allait devenir, quelques années plus tard, une farouche guérillera dans la Cuba de Castro, puis l'épouse d'un diplomate dans le Paris des existentialistes, ou encore une richissime aristocrate dans le swinging London. D'une époque, d'un pays à l'autre, Ricardo la suit et la poursuit, comme le plus obscur objet de son désir. Et chaque fois, il ne la retrouve que pour la perdre. Et, bien entendu, ne la perd que pour mieux la rechercher."

I knew I was in for a tough read when getting to a battle with gremlin/ogre something-or-others which occurs very early in the book.  AT MOST there were ten words describing the creatures and their methods of fighting.  Did the author really think that this was unimportant?  Perhaps I am being unfair to be so negative when I didn't finish the book, but that would have been impossible for me.  I am uncomfortable being so negative, but I just felt that I had to give fair warning.  If you can, read twenty or so pages before buying!"

3691,142720019X,R3JKUDSGBK2J7J,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2016",51 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"I stumbled across William Boyd a few years back after picking up ""Waiting for sunrise"" out of curiosity and then finding I was unable to book the book down. Since then, I have tended to snap up his novels quite regularly but I had delayed reading ""Restless"" having seen the TV adaption that was on the BBC a few years ago. Whilst this is perhaps considered Boyd's most exciting novel , I was really struck by the similarities with his recent re-working of James Bond, the terrific ""Solo"" which effectively out-trumps Fleming.  Like ""Solo"", the main protagonist is thrown in to a situation where they are out of their depth and the ending similarly hints that matters are not quite fully resolved. ""Restless"" is similarly a novel about the murky world of espionage and centres around the machinations to disseminate false news stories which , it is hoped, with prompt the United States to join in the war against Nazi Germany."

So why not 5 stars? Only because even the best male writer (so far as I've yet found) can't really write a female point of view, it always feels as if this is a boy telling you what's happening. There are good biological reasons why this should be so - a female person, even in action-packed circumstances, remains aware of a lot of detail that a male doesn't need to think about, and also tends to see more colours, and even perhaps differentiates tones of voice more acutely. I expect that when female writers try to represent a male point of view they also get it a bit wrong. And of course perhaps it doesn't matter: for it's a great complicated story, unputdownable."

The narrative alternates between WW2 (mainly 1939 -1942) and postwar in 1976 when Eva is a widow and Ruth (born in 1949) is an Oxford graduate and a single mother with a boy (Jochen) of her own. Ruth lives in Oxford teaching English (as a foreign language) to young professionals from overseas. Her mother (now in her sixties) lives about an hour's drive away, her deceased husband having left her reasonably well off financially."

His language and imagery is amazing and his characters well drawn.  The plot is a typical convoluted spy weave of trust and deceit which I thoroughly enjoyed..  Boyd must have researched the background well and he cleverly links the past WW2 with 1972.  However I did wonder why Eva was only now taking action to seek revenge and why her daughter had to be involved.  A jolly good read non the less.

The made-up english dialect creates such an interesting and fun spin for the audience& even past that it reaches such a deep psychological subject of the good and evil in men. The characters were also such a fantastic and creative group and kept the readers enjoying their antics. Overall, its a great fiction piece and read for those who are looking for a dystopian setting."

This book has great use of its dark futuristic (of the time that it was written)  setting. I liked how burgess showed who Alex was right in the beginning by  use of showing Alex and his friends prowling the streets, looking for  trouble. At first I didn't like the words that Alex used, but once I got  used to them, they added alot to the book. The book was written very well  and Burgess used very good character development."
3703,345316413X,R16RUE4WVI4SMZ,A Misunderstood Classic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2000",,,"Personally, This Is One Of My Favorite Books. I Think That Many People Are Turned Away From This Book Due To The Extremely Violent Content And Horrific Crimes Described Herein, But, Beneath The Violence And Crime Is A  Masterpiece That Gives A Terrifying Vision Of A Possible Future and Poses  An Important Moral Question. The Book Has Some Connections To Christianity  That Are Represented Mainly Through The Prison Chaplain. The Big Moral  Dilemma Of The Book Is Expressed Through The Title. Alex(The Narrator), Is  Subjected To A Treatment In Prison In Which He Is Shown Films Of Violence  And Sex, While Strapped To A Chair With His Eyes Forced Open And While  Feeling Extreme Nausea, Fear, Discomfort, And Feelings Of Paralysis. After  Alex Gets The Treatment In Prison, He Becomes A ""Clockwork  Orange,"" Something That Appears To Be Alive But Is In Fact Mechanical.  The Treatment Forces Alex To Be A Non-Violent, Non-Sexual person. Just The  Thought Of Sex Or Violence Causes Him To Become Incapacitaded By Feelings  Of Extreme Nausea And Severe Discomfort. Alex No Longer Has The Freedom To  Choose How To Behave And He Becomes A Slave To Fear, The Fear Of The  Effects Of The Treatment. Consequently, These Feelings Also Appear When  Alex Hears His One True Love In Life, The Music Of Beethoven. This Is Due  to The Fact That One Of The Treatment Films Had A Piece By Beethoven  Playing In The Background. The Chaplain Sums Up The Main Theme Of The Book  In One Statement: Is A Person Truly Good If They Have No Choice Between  Good Or Bad Behavior, And Are Forced To Do No Wrong. Basically, The Theme  Is The Connection Between Living And Freedom. It Seems To Me That What  Burgess Is Trying To Say Is That People Are Not Truly Alive If They Do Not  Have The Freedom To Choose How To Live Their Lives, And Without This  Choice, Are Nothing But Machines That Have The Characteristics Of Human  Beings. I Couldn't Agree More."

I picked it randomly from a list of books to do a project on, and was warned after about its intense violence, and difficult language. After reading it, though, I would rate it was one of the most worthwhile books I've read in my high school career.  I found Burgess's invented slang intriguing (although difficult to comprehend at first) and I felt that it added to Alex's character.  Burgess did an excellent job of developing each of the characters, and even though he was a cruel delinquent I often found myself feeling badly for Alex.  The last chapeter was the one that enjoyed the most (apparently it wasn't included in the original American versions) because it displayed so much hope for this troubled young man.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but would strongly warn the reader about its violence.  The book should not be read by those with a weak stomach!"

Anthony Burgess's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is an extremely well written book contaning strong imadges of violence, rape and the tendancies of a malicious youth mind. In the book, he undergoes a treatment in which his body is instructed to become sick. Once his ability to commit these acts has been stripped from him hes left in a world he can nolonger relate to, and a series of excellently written events transpire. This book is one i would reccomend reading twice solely for the many messages within the story that burgess inserts cleverly. Highly recommended"

Anthony Burgess's masterpiece of a novel is deeply intriguing, insightful, and enlightening on matters of free will and human rights.  Through the first person view and acts of violence on behalf of the central character, Alex, we gain insights into the moral issues of what the persuit of happiness can begin to mean; at what point does your pursuit of happiness begin to violate somone elses rights as a human?  And at what point does somone have the right to tell you that you cannot act a certain way?"

The main story is amazing.  The only thing I didn't realize is that half-way through it turns into short stories.  'I Am Legend' is just one of about a dozen short stories - it being the longest.  I would read a whole series on the main concept though.  First rate.

I am a fan of William Boyd and this was the best of his I have read so far, the story flipping between timelines is brilliant and shocking at times, The two central characters the Mother and Daughter are excellent especially with their interplay with the other characters in the separate timelines and the action is what makes this standout. Great read highly recommend it"
3772,142720019X,RGZ8NXSW2X5X8,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2013",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"I have read and loved William Boyd's books since his very first ones, but have failed to keep up to date with his prodigious output.  Picking up again this year with his excellent ""Any Human Heart"", I have been dipping in and out of his oeuvre, whilst reminding myself how cleverly he varies the type of books he can write, whilst involving you in the characters and plotlines, descriptions and places, seemingly effortlessly. This of course is the mark of a seriously talented writer.  OK, not all the books are completely even and some appeal to a certain audience more than others. Being on a bit of down time over Christmas, I attacked a few thrillers (not my first choice of reading), whizzing through ""the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (thought it was better than OK but not fantastic) before downloading ""Restless"" having read about the BBC film being made. Having only caught the first episode, I read the book before watching the recorded second episode.  I thought it was a really classy, well-written good, old-fashioned couldn't-put-it-down type thriller.  The characters had depth and interest, the situations appeared to involve you without suspending your belief and I loved the fact that at the end you were still slightly uncertain as to the ultimate fate of Eva/Sally.  Was she paranoid, did she merely enact the whole thing to involve her daughter, or were the Soviets really out to get her? (cleverly set in the 1970's, so not unfeasible.) I haven't enjoyed a book of this type so much for ages, and find it hard to understand why anybody thought it was slow - but horses  for courses. I also find it hard to understand why Boyd is somehow not as up there in the same critically exalted league as say, Martin Amis & Ian McEwan.  Perhaps the fact he writes beautifully well-structured, accessible books with interesting characters, reasonable plots and generally a beginning, middle and end is just too ""well-crafted"" for the literati. If you do like a well-crafted novel and a good read, then this definitely recommended. By the way, I had the Kindle edition and it was fine, so clearly the problems mentioned earlier have been rectified."
3773,142720019X,R2DGLQPMWF8Q2E,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 10, 2012",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Having re-read ""Restless"" some time after it first came out, I was surprised by just how much more I got out of it second time around, and what another fine piece of storytelling it is from William Boyd.  It's pretty much an action thriller with literary intent, and as usual, Boyd skilfully weaves a number of threads together to make for a compelling, compulsive read."

3775,142720019X,RJUPACN2GSJ99,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2013",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This is certainly a riveting read. Boyd's knowledge of the different worlds: Oxford, SIS, New York, Albuquerque etc is convincing, enjoyable to those without it. His detailed imagining does not interfere with the narrative drive, a rare gift. What is it really about? Betrayal of country, of colleagues: their murder. That the betrayer gets away with it does not mean that he is laughing at all those he has deceived (those still alive) but there would have to be moral satisfaction in the achievement of being a successful spy, even after 'retirement', right up to the grave, despite his eventual suicide.."
3776,142720019X,R332UH5LI0WGLD,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 1, 2021",,Verified Purchase,This book is a classic spy thriller ranging from 1939 to 1967.

He is a truly gifted storyteller.  He is a superbly knowledgeable historian of 2 world wars, and the inter-war years, but tells very human tales with impeccable style. I’m particularly fascinated with the way he writes from the perspective of females in this and Sweet Caress, (my absolute favourite thus far).  I found Restless slow to get into but in the end I was racing to finish chapters before my Kindle battery expired.  Highly recommended."

What a disappointment, irrelevant detail and dull subplots take up far too much paper and the plot itself is never fully resolved with a couple of pages at the end to tie up a few loose ends thrown in as an afterthought. The characters were not likeable and the constant  time lapses only to go back and explain what’s happened in the gap were confusing and pointless."

Kyrus is a scribe in a world where the printing press is just coming into fashion. Brannis is a soldier in a land where dragons, ogres and goblins abound.

It relates to a daughter who was completely unaware of her mother's real identify and the part she played as an agent in the Second World War.  The mother is writing her account which is revealed in single chapters and has a bearing on the past, present and future, bringing them closer but not without causing ripples in their joint lives.  A worth while book to take on holiday or just to relax with as it slowly unfolds."

The central protaganist is a young teaching engliish to foreign students and out of the blue her mother tells her that she, her mother was a spy for the UK during the cold war.  The book tells the mothers story by flashback and the daughter helps her mother to trakc down the man who had been her boss and her lover who led her into a trap and it was only by her own ingenuity that she survived.  IT was suspensful and exciting with a particular twist at the end.  An excellent book."

Searching for the best matching one, I've found 2 interesting: Barnes & Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch. My decision was based on the page-turning knobs implemented in the shell, which were lacking in Kobo device. I'm quite happy with Nook Touch, allthough don't really understand the politics behind the sale of the electronic books outside of North America. It's simply impossible to buy smething from NB, not having an adress in States or Canada. DRM coded books can be readed, but without the cover image - probably software issue. Few times, while pressing over the word, which of course highlighted the marking (without choosing any options) it went out of response from the touch screen. The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour."

4079,345316413X,R2M1ARMPUTMKGA,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 23, 2012",,Verified Purchase,"The random nature of ultraviolence is both its most frightening aspect and a clear indication of its evil. It leaves everyone feeling vulnerable because anyone could be a victim of an attack. And this is what makes this book so morally problematic. . In ordinary attempts to justify violence, some claim is made that gives a reason why the victim should be harmed. Such attempts focus on the identity of the recipient of justi'ed violence. In self-defense, one may harm one's assailant because the assailant poses a threat to one ís own well-being. In just war thinking there must be a just cause (usually aggression) and violence has to be focused exclusively against the aggressor. But ultraviolence spreads violence in a way that simply ignores the identities of its victims. It is random and unpredictable violence. In Michael Baur's words, it is ""systematically unsystematic."" The result of ultraviolence is to create panic and chaos, sometimes in order to advance a political agenda, although in the case of Alex and his droogs violence has to be divorced from a political agenda as a sort of nihilistic glee in causing disorder."

I saw the movie with Will Smith.  A lone survivor of a vampire plague who can’t venture anywhere further than a day’s round trip drive from his home. He’s driven mad with loneliness. He’s also intent on wiping out as many of these vampires as he finds. This is the only point on which the movie and the book agree upon. I was pleasantly surprised to read the book and discover a new ending, new characters, and a new storyline. Had it been exactly the same as the movie I might not have enjoyed it so much. The book contains subtle humour as Robert Neville is constantly harassed by his neighbour, Ben Cortman in the book. By the end you begin to feel sorry for poor old Cortman.

In the end, we see the greater truth that all types of people walk the same path as Christ works to bring us into His Kingdom. This was a hard read, but well worth it."

As you walk with him, you’ll begin to identify today’s many religious pitfalls.  As you walk with him, you’ll begin to identify today’s many religious pitfalls. These are presented by men such as Pliable, who turns back at the Slough of Despond; and Ignorance, who believes he’s a true follower of Christ when he’s really only trusting in himself. Each character represented in this allegory is intentionally and profoundly accurate in its depiction of what we see all around us, and unfortunately, what we too often see in ourselves. But while Christian is injured and nearly killed, he eventually prevails to the end. So can you.”"

The story follows the main character (from both sides) through their development in realizing that the dreams they have are real and effect both of their lives. Cross world Conspiracy, love triangles, pirates, magic, and coming of age all combine to be a delightful read.

Kyrus is a sorcerer born into a world with no magic, and Brannis is a knight born into a world teeming with magic.  Both men dream of each other's lives and must save one another, despite living in different worlds.  The author attempts an innovative idea, exploring the ways in which different universes are connected to one another.  I enjoyed the book, although I found it overlong.  Despite this, the characters  did display some complexity and humanity, which is something I look for in a complex novel with intertwining plotlines.  I enjoyed the ways in which the characters had to rely on one another, despite not knowing one another physically.  The end of the novel left me wondering if there were other ""twins"" in other ""worlds who had not yet connected. I look forward to reading the other books in this series."

This is an idea that has been explored in many science fiction stories as well as fantasy and yet the depths of the idea have clearly not been plumbed yet as evidenced by this book. In this first, of what promises to be a very interesting trilogy, we see how various people interact amongst parallel universes. The two universes in this series are Koriah and Acardia and the connections between them are that people in one universe see how their counterparts in the other conduct their lives in their dream state.  So, Brannis Solaran, who is a Knight dreams of the life of Kyrus Hinterdale who is a scribe, and vice versa. While these two are connected through some sort of unexplained link, so are another pair. To add interest to these links, the world that Brannis occupies uses magic and has a high regard for Sorcerers, while Kyrus's world is more technologically focused and the use of magic is very actively discouraged."

This book blew me away and captivated me from start to finish.  Many characters are well fleshed out and often shown in shades of grey. Good guys can do bad things depending on the situation, and the bad guys do have good moments and may even do something honorable.  Black and white characters are boring.

It was most inconvenient.

Spiritual growth is shoe-horned into the protagonist's life through the plot device of a house that grows rooms full of cool toys and stunningly obvious metaphors designed to support the main character's dead-uncle-and-God-administered psychotherapy. This unfortunate book is filled with magic passed off as ""miracles"", something that should make an intelligent Christian shudder.  Worse, the pace is painfully slow, a mechanism clearly intended to create anticipation in the reader in the absence of interesting content.  The writing technique isn't terrible, but the same can't be said for either the plot or the character development - all sad parodies of real human beings: vapid, self-absorbed, and so completely lacking in self-awareness that I'm hard pressed to think of anyone actually like this."

It's well worth the cost and should be considered an exceptional value.  There are coupons for many of the casinos I would be going to anyway, but it also encourages me to branch out and visit ""new"" casinos that I might not otherwise get to just to take advantage of the coupons.  I use both the match play and dining coupons.  I'm lucky in that I get to house-sit for friends who live in LV, considerably west of the Strip, and I have use of their car, so I can easily get around.  If you're stuck on the Strip, you might not get as much use out of the guide, but remember, it's not only good for coupons, it's also a good source of gambling information generally.  I highly recommend the guide.  Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't buy it year after year!"

Also, there's several free slot play coupons, which I used and won a few dollars, and in turn, used that won money with the match play coupons (essentially, gambling for free).  The only caveat is that with most of these coupons, you need to become a new member of the casinos players club.  I would suggest that you use these coupons during the day, to avoid long lines and any embarrassment."

Since my husband was celebrating his birthday the day we arrived, we took advantage of several 'free money on your birthday' opportunities listed in the book, as well as a discount at my favorite buffet.

There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work.

A First for a Holmes novel. Found it well written and in the style of the original canon. I just found the resulting subject matter to be unnecessary and distasteful. It may be an historically accurate subject, but I do not read the canon or pastiches to be reminded of today's debauched headlines. I read them to escape to a simpler time when the Master and his loyal friend would cut through the fog and save the day. I read them to escape the ugliness of the world. This book reminded me too much of what is prevalent today. No disrespect meant to the author."

Eva ,the main character is recruited by the mysterious and ultimately unknowable spymaster Romer. The book charts her assignments and their affair, as told by Eva to her daughter years later. The author skilfully draws the reader into the troubled , uncertain , desperate lives of the spies, using the late 20th century focus provided by Eva's daughter's ordinary life, as a contrast. The writer skilfully shows the cost to those who chose or were persuaded into spying and this aspect of the book is powerful and disturbing .  I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a well written and intelligent thriller."

I have tried opening up the case and re-seating the  circuit boards, which fixed most of the problems, but the digitizer is  permanently inaccurate. Even with re-calibration of the digitizer using  preferences, the location the Palm thinks I'm hitting with the stylus is  wrong, and this makes using the Palm impossible."

Because we carry the book in our motorhome it gets handled more than if it was sitting on a shelf at home and even though we have learned to handle it carefully it keeps disassembling itself.

There is a BOGO for the Rio's amazing buffet. If you only use that coupon for dinner, you've paid for the cost of the book. Just picked up our 2010 copy for our trip to Vegas early next month.

However, this years edition requires you when using the coupons to comply with a new condition printed on the coupon. It states: ""Offer void if detached from book. This coupon should only be removed at the time of redemption."" The author states in his remarks in the book as well as his remarks here on Amazon that this was done as a reult of abuses and counterfeiting of the coupons. I can understand this and have no problem with this. My problem is the fact that there are three coupons per page and the coupons do not have preforations to easily remove the coupon at the time of use. This is especially hastlesome if you need to use the middle coupon, as you usually end up ripping the top and bottom coupons trying to evenly remove the center coupon. A little common sense and forethought should have been used when designing the coupon section of the book......maybe next year's issue will come with a pair of mini scissors. Other than this years coupon 'preforation oversight' this book is well worth the money."

Boy, were they right. Couldn't put it down, read it in just over 24 hours.

You really notice the sound quality and the different features such as ""groove"" and ""mega bass"" functions. The water resistant  body is also good for pool side listening. The head phones that are  included are not very good ones and are easy to break. They also feel very  weak when you wear them. The anti-shock memory could have more capacity but  with the locking hood, it helps. This is a great CD player until it begins  to age. After a year and two months, mine started to act up. You would have  to push play three or four times before it would start. The LCD screen  started to blink and go out at times. Eventually you have to put foil on  the button inside or else the CD player will not know the lid is closed.  Then my motor went out. This is a good player but for a short amount of  time."

It only occasionally worked.  After three years, the unit stopped working altogether.  After taking the unit apart to see what is wrong with it, I've discovered opening and closing the waterproof top contributes to the destruction of the unit.  When you open the top, you will notice a series of connectors in a plastic electronic strip at the bottom of the lid, below this the electronic strip is folded in an awkward way, which after several hundred openings, the slight tension causes the strip to naturally sever, hence the unit ceases to operate.  The sad fact of the matter is I've owned this unit for three years and only used it for about 100 hours of operation.  Not much!"

Morin’s plot device consists of two worlds linked and running side by side which makes this story very interesting. It allows for some fun character interaction across the link and uniquely affects how the characters behave in each world. I really enjoyed the plot devices impact on the story and it is used well."

The characters are well developed, the two worlds are clearly differentiated and yet connected, and the plot had me staying up late trying to finish. Unfortunately, there were a few issues of style that kept jolting me out of my enjoyment, specifically the author's tendency to keep falling out of POV. I realize that omniscient 3rd is a valid narrative decision, and it can work, but the abrupt changes between solid, in-their-head 3rd person and objective character description - and then right back - kept throwing me, and at times seemed rather random, as did the jumps between characters in the same place. For example, at one point Brannis and Iridan are in the same place, viewing the same event, and both their reactions are shown in quick succession, which was slightly jarring. In another place, Rashan's actions are shown from a distance rather than from his POV for no apparent reason. The biggest offender, though, is the description of the characters the first time you meet them - detailed, and helpful for building up a mental image, but objective and from an outside viewpoint, and usually dropped in the middle of a passage that is anything but."

The IR port  makes it possible to beam data to Palm owning friends and the solid, no  frills operating system and software are easy to use and crash free.  If I  had a complaint, it would be that graffiti is not as intuitive as I would  like.  It could have something to do with my sloppy writing, but the Palm  seems so smart in other ways that I expect it to do better.  Still,  Graffiti is more than adequate for entering the occasional appointment or  business card.  This Palm has performed for me as advertised.  My life is  more organized and I have more valuable information at my fingertips.  It  is reliable and easy to use."

There is software which will allow you to track your  banking and merge the data with Quicken or other banking software, store  maps, look up a zip code or area code, download entire books, play games,  create shopping lists, and with a modem, even let you surf the internet, or  send and receive e-mail and faxes. I even have my entire CD collection of  over 600 cd's stored by artist, title and song name which I converted from  a spreadsheet and stored on my Palm.

Its been a great back up when I've been on the road rushing about my job and even when my employer changed all office based PCs from 98 to XP, the palm download upgrade accessed from the net gave me no problems with compatibility. Mine just will not die, even in the past when I have noticed a brief screen issue with the odd rare black out and thinking has it finally reached its holy grail, it always sorts itself out and gets back to normal fairly quickly.I have had it so long that I cannot remember if I could edit the downloaded excel and word docs with the stylus. It does not do it now so it might have failed in one aspect. The PC software has always been very user friendly and I use both the hand held and the PC on a regular basis to edit its data.

I can't compare it to the Amazon Paperwhite, because I refuse to try one.  The Nook has expandable memory (which I do not believe the Paperwhite does).  Up to 32GB, which means I can save around 32,000 books.  If, for some reason, I need more space, then I can just drop another 15-20 bucks, and have another 32GB (though I will have my collection split over two memory cards).  I also like that B&N accepts ePub, which is pretty much the universal standard, whereas Amazon locks you into their own store.  This means that you can shop Sony's store with a Nook, and Nook's store with a Sony, but Amazon can't access either of those stores."

I've enjoyed Sherlock Holmes stories since boyhood, and read many extensions of the works, and this ranks among the best. The writing style is strongly aligned with Conan Doyle's, the mysteries are solved in the inimitable Holmes style, and the locales are captured wonderfully. I rarely have my eyes nailed to the page throughout the resolution of a novel, but from start to finish, Horowitz keeps you riveted. After so many Jack Reacher-esque books, one begins to despair that someone can finish a novel as strongly as they start it. Reading this is like returning to a gallery filled with masters' works after tiring of shoddy modern stuff. Great, and reassuring that the genre has not been drained of elegance, style, and complexity."

My only real problem with the machine is it doesn't pull in the channels as well as it should. For that reason I only record shows I plan to watch and tape over. I use my SONY to tape any shows I wish to save and have a noce copy of. However, to dub tape to tape or watch commercial tapes, it is a great machine. It is very easy to use and I like that I never have to reset the clock, not even for daylight savings time. But I bought it to tape from the TV, and it is a very poor machine for that.

After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase the Palm IIIx...and I have to say that the product more than lives up to the reviews.

4797,B00000IGBF,R1WGO2491T55K,Serious design flaw hinders reliability,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2000",44 people found this helpful,,"I am a first time owner of the Palm IIIx and I am currently searching for an alternative.  I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago, and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer (to HotSync  and restore the data) all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.  If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you, follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  (the one with the 'bump') must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Let's say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse,  briefcase, backpack, fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag, set it  down a little too hard, or even RUN with it, chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and you'll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost, I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second, I can't believe that they didn't install a back-up  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason (let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data).  Finally, 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.  The Palm IIIx is SUPPOSED to be a  powerful tool for powerful people.  I'd be surprised if the execs at 3Com  would utilize their own product."

Although my Palm got the date right, some of the pixels on the screen would stay lit no matter what program was running.  At first the ""Customer Care  Center"" with Palm accused me of dropping it or something;  ""physical damage"".  They told me it would cost me $100 (US) to  have it replaced (I assumed a new unit). This really irrtated me.  When I  bought it (Dec. '99)it worked fine, when I replaced the batteries once, I  started to have problems like this.  Eventually, after some serious,  pissiness on the phone with representitive, they offered me a used unit.  I  sympathize with the electronics fan.  After all, it doesn't even feel like  mine, call me crazy, but I bought MINE not someone else's.  So far the used  Palm has worked fine, but I would really like them to fix their mistakes  for us insted of shipping off the other misfit products to their customers."

At first,  I thought it would be very difficult starting from ground zero to use and  transfer information from other desktop programs. But with the help of an  ""Idiot"" book on the Palm it was very easy. It was a big help. I  hope I find my Day Timer before tax time or the IRS will have a field day  with me and my mileage expenses!  Some programs like Card Scan were tricky  to transfer data but I managed. This is not against the Palm, but rather,  programs that give little explaination to help make a smooth transfer of  data to the Palm. Another WOW! Someone just found my Day Timer in  Baltimore!"

It took a few weeks to get used to using a PDA, but once I did, it  has saved me time and time again as I have not once doubled booked an  appointment since having this device.  Right now it's the lowest cost 3com  unit that has the upgradable OS capability, which I think is an important  feature.  If you have the $50, you might as well move up to the xe and get  the extra 4 mb of memory, but if you don't and need a workhorse, there  isn't much the more expensive IIIxe will do that the IIIx can do just as  well.

If you use Avantgo daily, then the V is going to hold  you back from fully utilizing this great site.The Vx, which is still pricy,  is an 8meg unit and far beyond the needs of the average user.If price is no  object, then this a great unit, except for the re-charging needs of being  in a cradle.

It was just frozen on the screensaver and no matter whether I plugged it into the computer or the wall, it didn't respond. I called the company and was told to bring it into my nearest story (which is about an hour and half away). She got it to charge and boot up for me saying that the battery was dead even though I had fully charged it the previous day. FFWD 9 months and my nook still kept freezing. It would freeze while reading a book, or browsing the B&N store or wouldn't load up from the screen saver. The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot. My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing. The second I unplugged it, it would freeze on me and I'd have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me. I called the company, they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook. Apparently, as you might have guessed, my Nook had a faulty battery. There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it.

First, it cannot find the beginning of tracks on your CD.  For example, if you scan ahead to track #12, it usually cannot find the track, and the times that it does, it often takes as many as FIVE minutes.  The rest of the time it just spins endlessly.  Second, the batteries died on me after using it for only about two hours.  Apparently, it does not shut itself off correctly.  And when the batteries died, the battery indicator was still showing that the batteries were fully charged.  Third, if you open the CD player while it is turned on and switch the CD, it will not let you play the CD.  You must wait a full minute for it to turn itself off before you can begin using it again.  At over 50% off the list price, I thought it was a good deal.  But when you're talking about a total piece of junk that must be either returned or thrown in the garbage, even 99 cents would be too high a price to pay.  Don't take the risk with this low quality product -- it's just not worth the time, money, or headache!"

It does not come with good accssories, but the sound quality is SUPERIOR to any CD player that I have ever listened too! The bass in the supplied headphones is awesome and didn't hiss when I increased the volume. I liked it for a while, but I took it back and got the Sony D-EJ715 CD Walkman whcih I LOVE!!! The Sony CD player offers all the features of the RCA player but includes a wired remote, a sleek-smaller design, a longer battery life, street-style headphones, rechargeable batteries, a carrying case, and a built-in charging capability which the RCA player doesn't offer. So if you have the extra money go for any of the new line of Sony CD players which offer ""G-Protection"". My Sony model which is D-EJ715 cost on average $129.99 but is worth every cent."

I also like the fact that I can play CD-RW in this CD Player, but the bad thing is it only has about 10 to 11 hours playback so get some rechargeable batteries I recommend NI-CD or NI-Mh batteries.

I take notes in class and print them out with my desktop comp. I  also have a color cover, and that makes it look brighter. The backlit  screen is great!"

I have an iPad mini, an ipad 4 and several other devices but none of them can hold a candle to the Nook Simple Touch Reader.

THEY ARE GREAT. Especially for the reader who doesn't really care to consume other media (tv, movie, internet, music) on a 7-inch tablet. I have an iPhone and a laptop, but do a superior job in their respective field. The 13-inch laptop screen is just better for watching things.

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add ""epub download"" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done."

LIke Amazon, B&N tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device. I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen. This proved a prudent choice since the touch screen on the NST started malfunctioning about 6 months in. At first, using a Q-Tip to clean the edges of the screen worked (it's not a calibrated screen, but works using light sensors that can be blocked by dust). Then certain areas of the screen completely stopped working. I could not access my library, etc. I'll spare you the details of my four infuriating chats with B&N customer service, but I ended up returning my Nook more than two weeks ago for them to look at and replace with a functional unit. I have heard nothing about its status since."

4992,B00000IGBF,R25TS4LDYP0ISR,Palm IIIx packs a punch for less,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2000",27 people found this helpful,,"The Palm IIIx is a less expensive alternative to the PalmV. Comparing featues, I didn't find much to warrant shelling out the extra $100. Sure, the V is thinner and lighter (by a few ounces) but $100 more for less RAM  and a rechargable battery? Flash upgrade the OS ASAP, backup your data to a  PC and you're off and running *without* a laptop. I connect to my e-mail  server from almost anywhere through my Motorola phone. The IIIx is by far  the best organizational tool I've ever used!"

However, about halfway into the book I began to get very annoyed.  It seems like the message the author wants you to take away from this book is that you can't be successful and also be close to God and live the way He wants his followers to.  ie. money and success = evil so make sure you give it all up if you want to be close to God.  How about trying money + success used the right way for the glory of God?  Hmmmmm that never seems to make it into these novels.  The book does have some good messages that do make you think and also has some plot twists that are interesting.  It could have been a MUCH better book though."

With 2 months of light use, after numerous lock/hang issues, mine is a brick and cannot be be rebooted.  B&N has offered a REFURB unit as a warranty replacement - underwhelming for such a new and obviously flawed device.  My experience is not unique, many have had similar issues.  It should not be that hard to deliver a bulletproof eReader, it has very limited function, not like a general purpose computer running code from various vendors.  Application code/device driver stack is not strong.  Hardware appears to be reasonable.  Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.  The UI is learnable in a relatively short time,  but not intuitive as an eReader should be.  The eReader UI experience should be closer to an iPhone experience, instead of a VCR timer event recording from the 80's (like it is).  Recommendation to B&N, get different software development team with experience writing bulletproof production code for 2.0.  Full rewrite of Nook Simple Touch code recommended."

I know Amazon won't let me list prices, but at the time I'm writing this the current ""list price"" is 40% higher than the actual in-store price.  Even with Amazon's current discount, it's higher.

There is no backlight which greatly reduces eye strain compared with other ereaders. The interface is laid out in easy to use functions and the pages actually look like those of a real book. Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends. All purchase books are your forever compared to other ebook services who may take the boom away when the publisher ends digital publishing. If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook. Great for any age too! (Font sizes are adjustable. Yay!)"

The 8-hour tapes are equally as bad as these 6-hour ones.  They are now made in Korea instead of formerly in Canada and that might have something to do with the serious decline in quality. After 1-4 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls, there are severe dropouts and the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one. I checked some of my other new Maxell tapes and most of them had the same results. I tried a TDK tape and was relieved to find that my VCR was still functioning perfectly so I threw out all of my new Maxells and am now using TDK and Sony tapes, which work just fine.

Maxell on the other hand still is putting out good quality tape, and they are consistantly good quality with no tracking issues.

To give little away, the way the transatlantic revenge plot is resolved is simply breathtaking, even if it were taken on its own, especially the identity of the perpetrator. The national crime ring is straightforward Holmes action story - together with Horowitz's keen knowledge of the canon, it makes for a first-rate Holmes whodunit."

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses."

That being said, I've heard complaints from others about older models and have people at work compare their kindles to my nook touch and they think mine is sweet.  For me the size is perfect and once you play around with it, it is very easy to navigate.  It only has wi fi and no 3G but that may not matter to some.  I'm very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the B&N accessories are a little on the high side.  I mean really, you're paying 140 bucks for the reader, you shouldn't have to shell out $30 for a case.  Other than that, I think it's really cool and it doesn't have any of the web browser/mp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.

I successfully set up the WiFi to communicate with my home WAP-protected router. After that first time, WiFi never worked again. It always says the connection was unsuccessful. Obviously the password and SSID were correct since it worked the first time. Wiped out the old settings, re-entered everything: no dice. This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer. Honestly, that USB download process is buggy too. At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display. But then a few days later it decided to show up on the Library list on the Nook too. I have 3 computers on secure home wireless and they all worked the first time and 100% of the time after too. Not the Nook. It's at 3% and going down. At least it can still read a book which somehow actually got downloaded. From what I've read, calling B&N tech support is a waste of time. Besides, I'm an experienced electronics engineer. It's not like I've never done this stuff before. Garbage software, grossly inadequate SW QA."

I love the feel and smell of a book.  Plus, there is something about seeing the progress, and holing it in your hands that I just love.  My husband has the original nook, and I tried out a book on it.  It was ok, but it was big, and clunky and heavy.  So, the new nook has that going for it.  I  downloaded a book right away and fell in love with it.  It's easy to buy books on it, share them, and my husband and I could  read the same book at the same time and it didn't mess with where each other were at in the book.  I love that I can tap the page and it turns, but that's also why I gave it four stars because my kids will tap the screen or it will get touched as I put it down, then when I pick it back up it's on a different page.  I do love some features about it that are much improved over the old nook.  It's so much easier to look up the meaning of a word, you can have a wish list for books you want to buy, which you can't do on the old one.  I also love that you can pick your font and size of the font.  Any book you buy can become a large print...for those that need it.  While I still pick  up a regular book, my nook is enjoyable, and easy to take along, doesn't rip or get torn up.  I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader."

Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle."

The interface doesn't have the ease of use that I was expecting, but I have only ever used apple touchscreen products so I suppose I had set the bar a bit too high. The only thing that actually bothers me is the lack of control of the organization of the shelves, but it's not so bad. In terms of durability, I was happy to see that the product holds up well, and hasn't broken. I also like the way it feels to read on the nook, it doesn't give me a headache and is actually easier than a normal book. All of that being said, I haven't used my nook since about three months ago. I had begun to read and buy books, and though I enjoyed reading on the nook, I realized that I liked having a physical book, and watching my book collection expand on the shelf. With the books I owned on the nook, it hardly even felt like I owned them. It was just a file. Because of this, I haven't bought any more ebooks, and thus haven't really had a reason to use my nook. Once my local library has a better selection of ebooks available, I think I would begin to use it more. But I would only recommend this product if your library has a good selection of ebooks, or if you don't mind not owning a physical book."

It claims to have support for common image formats such as jpg and bmp but in actuality it does not. The only way it can display an image is through its screen saver which would be ok except the screen saver can not be cycled and pops up a random picture from a folder so there is no way to view a specific file.  If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying ""this nook cannot read this file.  It may be an unsupported format.""

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N. If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two."

So far it has been PERFECT!!! I am glad I chose it over the kindle. I have not had the screen freeze thing thats been happening. I see some people have had it though. But anyway the keyboard works well and is surprisingly responsive, the page turns are perfect (definitely faster than it would take you to turn the page in a real book) and the layout is beautiful and clean and also simple to navigate. Im still finding new things that my nook simple touch can do! The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people. The memory is great with 236 mb of internal memory and the ability to upgrade to atleast 16 gigs maybe even 32 gigs im not sure of that though. But trust me I have 145 full books(and a few wallpapers) on my nook and I havent even gotten through  half of the 236mb internal memory let alone the 4 gig micro-sd card I bought for it so dont let the small memory size fool you as book files are TINY! The nook does exactly what its designed to do, (which is be an ereader), perfectly! The browser is pointless and has been removed with the most recent update but trust me, you arent going to miss the browser as it was slow and annoying anyway. If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet). If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get."

If you purchase books from Barnes and Noble, you must have a valid credit card on file any time you want to access the material that you have already paid for, and downloaded. The Digital Rights Management software that B&N uses requires a credit card to validate your ownership of the book. This may sound like no big deal, but when your credit card expires in the middle of a book, you will not have access to the book until you renew your credit card. This is because the Nook requires you to download the book repeatedly, every few days, to make sure you still own the book. It is not enough to pay for the book and to download it once, you need to download it again and again. Essentially, they are revoking your access to a book you have already paid for. They may as well sneak back into your house and steal the book off of your bookshelf."

I can program up to 8 different blocks of time and it only  takes about 30 seconds to program for one recording. Actually installing it  to my TV and attatching the cable took about a minute. I didn't refer to  the directions at all the entire time. And once it was all plugged in, it  did all this stuff instantly and was ready to go. GET THIS VCR."

I was so impressed, i also went out and got the  PV-945H. This one is just as good if not better and has some added  custimize onscreen labels for programs. Super vcrs! The only problem is the  odd shape of the remote."

Big mistake on my part - it started malfunctioning the day I opened it (touch screen didn't work and the on/off button stuck). My fault, I thought, I should have gotten it far enough in advance to test it out first. When I got back at the end of May, I called customer service to let them know about the problems, and they said I could send it in and get a free replacement. I sent it via UPS at the beginning of June. After not hearing anything for 3 weeks, I called to see if there was a problem. They said they had just received the Nook, which I find extremely unlikely since it's never taken UPS that long to deliver one of my packages. After waiting another 5 weeks without any sign of the Nook, I called them again this week to see what the deal was. I tell the customer service rep I sent the Nook in two months ago, and he acts surprised and says he'll see if he can find out what the problem is. He then calls someone in another department and informs me the Nook will be shipping out soon. No explanation whatsoever as to why the Nook has been sitting in their warehouse for 2 months. Basically, I've had this Nook for 10 months total and have never been able to use it, and they didn't even offer expedited shipping to make up for their mistake. Extremely unhappy with the service overall, and really regretting not getting a Kindle now. Buyer beware."
5629,140053271X,R1634L7SKALNH6,4 for the product 0 for loss of functionality/poor support,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2011",30 people found this helpful,,"OK so a rating of 1 for the product itself is unfair.  This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.  Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.  If you escalate, you will eventually get to B&N personnel who will acknowledge the problem and proceed to give you a non-answer.  If you compare this experience to the recent Kindle Fire problems you find Amazon.com stating they have a problem, what they are doing to fix it and an estimate of when things will be better.  Recent announcements tell you that Amazon.com has followed through on this and that the first batch of fixes are already available.  Barnes and Noble, acting in a manner that is the reverse of Amazon.com, continues to let those with the Wi-Fi problem live with that problem.  While you will not find any reference to the problem on the B&N site a Google search on ""Barnes and Noble Simple Touch W-Fi problems"" or a similar search, will give you a better feel for Simiple Touch owners who are struggling.  SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N person).  For PC owners with Internet access, you can still connect to B&N from your PC, buy your E-product, download it and transfer it to your Simple Touch.  Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.  Of course another solution would be to 1.Acknowledge the problem, 2.State and estimated date when a resolution may be available. 3.Fix the problem and announce the fix.  Amazon.com did this.  Why can't Barnes and Noble? Good luck to those without this problem.  You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.  The reading experience is quite nice.  And for 1.1.X, lets hope it doesn't introduce you to the Barnes and Noble problem resolution experience."

It isn't backlit like computers, so it doesn't cause headaches as it does for many to read on computers; it's more like reading a book. It's more convenient, however, because the pages don't turn of their own accord when it is set down, and it is lighter than a book. In addition, though many ebooks are sold at the same list price as the book itself, the Barnes & Noble site allows users to download many free ebooks in addition to buying. This is a space-efficient way for those who read many books to own books; it is not necessary to have walls of bookshelves, because the Nook holds many digital versions of the same books which one could buy in a physical form. There are, of course, issues with it, as there are with any form of technology. The fact that it runs on battery leaves one in danger of running out of power in a place without a charger. In addition, the screen occasionally freezes, requiring the manual shutdown of the device to return it to normal. These, however, are not major detriments when compared to the massive gains. The Nook is definitely worth the money, even though it costs considerably more than a book would."

And as you can see, it's been praised and hyped to the moon by critics and Baker Street Irregulars everywhere.  I evidently read another book, unfortunately.  I give Horowitz two stars for style, which he replicates nicely, at least at first - but his plot and mystery I found to be deadly dull.  It became a real slog for me to get through to the end.  All the while, I knew exactly where the ""mystery"" was headed and the resolution was just as distasteful and off-putting as I expected.  I'm really surprised nobody else had a problem with the actual House Of Silk and it's particularly nasty trade.  I don't shock easy, and you expect dark criminal doings with Holmes...but this kind of crime felt too real/disturbing for what is essentially meant to be a fun popcorn entertainment.  Even without that objection though, the plot was slow, obvious and - sin of sins - boring."

I have the 1st generation Nook and I love it, but I was always envious of my friends NookColor's touchscreen.  Now, I didn't want all the bells and whistles that the NookColor or the 1st Gen Nook has, I just wanted a simple eReader and I got that and more.  I think what I love best about the Simple Touch Nook is how light it is, I can hold it in one hand and if I put it in my bag or purse it doesn't weigh it down.  The touch screen is very responsive and makes turning pages a whole lot more simpler than my 1st gen Nook.  The e-ink seems a little bit more crisper than on the 1st gen Nook and being able to adjust the font size is great!  I do miss the replaceable battery of the 1st Gen Nook, but the battery life on the Simple Touch is amazing!  I got mine on June 3rd and charged it up to 100% and I haven't charged it since.  Now of course I don't read as much as some do...I maybe average about 1 hour a day, but to go almost an entire month and not have to charge the battery is amazing.  I wish they would offer a silicone frame for it, because the cover I have for it adds more weight.  I will say that a cover really isn't necessary, the Simple Touch front has a rubberized frame that invites you to use without a cover though you might just want to use a cover for protection when you're not reading.  It's just a wonderful eReader."

The player also features repeat play  functions (1/all) and a two-digit LCD screen. If you are on the move like me, you should invest the extra money, and buy a player with an anti skip feature, like this one.  As well, the Ultra slim feature of this product makes it handy to even carry in a large pocket, if you are walking down the street with a jacket or even pants with larger pockets.  It is a very attractive player, and the car kit is a definite bonus. The one downer about the product is the chinsy headphones that comes with it.  Casio always seems to have headphones that I could get for free on an airplane.  Koss has the upper hand in this department. But alas, I still give it 4 stars, because I have always had great success with Casio products, and this machine has so many excellent features.

That's when I saw this. I was skeptical about buying it, I had gotten use to the expensive stuff. But since I was desperate I bought it anyway and I was sure surprised. The Anti-Skip works just as good if not better than the more expensive ones. The bass-boost sounds like something you'd find in a Sony. And it just topped it with the Car adapter. You don't even get that in a $70 set. Total knockout.

I wanted to read it with my kids before watching the movie.  We did, and it was pretty good, but it was short and the ending was a let down.  Also there is definitely adult content.  The main character is alone in a zombie infested world so it is not surprising that the main character is troubled in a way that kids may not understand or be ready for.  Also, I did not like that ""I am Legend"" is just one of the stories in this book.  The story could have been longer because it was good although different than the movie.  I was not interested in the other stories that the book offered.  Also, one last thing, I was most intrigued by the authors take on the zombie nature...this zombie actually has some intelligence!!"

The thing that really ticks me off is  that that company only made what they had to and no more, that really  peeves me, they should of and could of put a lot more effort into this, but  they only gave what they had to, it's a really awesome design, but there  should be more behind it.

The only thing that I don't have anymore are the headphones, but those were actually cheap. I think they took about 6 months to a year to break? They still worked fine, but they had broken off from the tracking. Anyways, it's a really amazing piece even without the headphones --  plus I was able to get a new pair that I enjoy more."

Second it doesn't have a resume button, so you have to start your cd all over again. It lacks a place for a remote. It's just too much of a hassle. The only real good thing about it is maybe it has 40 sec esp. I wouldn't recommend that this a cd player as a thing to make a big deal about."

Well, it won't intercept your emails while the PC's off, or grab faxes for you, or page you when an  email arrives, but if you want those things you're in completely the wrong  price-range.  In reallity, I found setting this modem up to be very simple  and straight forward, though I can see how the complete novice may get a  little confused, and it has so far been a solid performer giving good  connection speeds without sacrificing accuracy. My neighbour uses a $200  modem, and gets precisely the average 48 KBPS connection speeds that I get  on this little budget gem. I'm not going into design features and build  quality and all the other things you may be interested in if you were  spending silly money, and as for reliability, well mine hasn't flinched in  2 years, so if it blows tomorrow I'll consider I had my money's worth.  Capable and reliable this is a great choice for the budget conscious."

I owned one for 3 years until it got zapped during a thunderstorm recently and now I am hunting around for another one. You get rock solid connections and excellent throughput and download speeds but one thing that really stands out is its ability to shrug off bad line conditions. I had installed dsl before my modems demise and it performed flawlessly even with the additional line noise brought on by dsl. If you are looking around for a modem as backup to your dsl/cable then look no further. You will be hard pressed to find a finer modem. BTW my pc is a Pentium 200mhz just so you know that this modem is totally undemanding on cpu cycles, in fact its minimum system requirements is a 100mhz cpu! If you look at other int modems out there you will see much higher cpu requirements because the modem depends on your cpu to do some of its work, but not this one! An excellent buy! No other modem comes close in terms of performance."

I've long been a fan of William Boyd. He writes with highly descriptive, flowing, easily readable style. Each of his books is very different from the last. ""Restless"" is about Russian born Eva Delectorskaya, who becomes an agent for the British secret service during WWII. However, the book is set in 1976, and the story is told by Eva's daughter who belatedly finds out about her mother's past. The chapters alternate between Eva's wartime spy stories, which are brilliant and utterly absorbing, and the 1976 exploits of her daughter which are not quite so entertaining. I actually formed quite a dislike to the daughter very early in the book. I don't know whether or not Boyd intended this. However it didn't spoil the novel for me and the overall reading experience was extremely good. I would strongly recommend this novel."

Ancora di più, se la mamma 2.0, si rivela essere stata un'attivissima membro dei servizi segreti militari inglesi. Sempre grande nella narrazione e nella lingua, un inglese semplice e non banale. Una storia solo apparentemente gialla (anche se potente), perché a Boyd, in fin dei conti, ciò che interessa è indagare l'agnizione e il mondo delle possibili personalità e vite alternative (grande esempio in Ordinary Thunderstorms...ad esempio) di un individuo, non necessariamente migliori. Da leggere e godere."

By moving between the two worlds, Boyd's tale slowly reveals a WWII espionage endeavour. The two women are original and interesting and completely credible. Boyd's sensitivity to telling details of setting create the worlds of mother and daughter with ease. By dispensing detailed accounts intermittently, suspense is sustained ( improbable events aside) until a satisfying resolution."

Durchaus großes Lesevergnügen. Nur wenn dann in den 70er-Jahren undurchsichtige Deutsche auftauchen, die vielleicht Beziehungen zur RAF haben könnten, dann wird die Geschichte billig. Hier scheint Boyd sich an einem Motiv zu vergreifen, von dem er, mangels Ahnung und ohne emsige Recherche, besser die Finger gelassen hätte. Das ist übrigens in ""Any Human Heart"" ebenso. Die deutsche Terroristenszene der 70er taugt nicht als Randmotiv."

Then I have no time left to actually read anything and I'm left frustrated and annoyed.  E-readers seem great in theory, but are a nightmare in practice.  I guess I can't speak for the kindle, but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.  Do yourself a favor and stick to the printed books.  No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.  All the copyright protection surrounding e-books makes them absolutely a horrible value for the money you spend and a waste of time on top of it all.  And when you leave your e-reader in the taxi, at the restaurant, or some opportunistic thief snatches it when your not looking, you are out $100.  What thief would target your $6 paperback?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."

I'm a vanity person and I couldn't care less about how well a product works as long as it's pretty. As long as it works, it's fine. Also I'm a very simple minded person so I only use it for reading. And those 2 things are what I'm reviewing. I fell in love with this ereader the moment I laid eyes on it. It was like they finally made one for me. I do not buy anything that is not fully touch screen if it can be. I would feel old and degraded. So the fact that they finally came up with this is like magical. No glare, but touch screen is exactly what I wanted from an ebook reader. It works perfect and it's so cute and pretty. It does exactly what it's for. Displays books for you to read. Plus even if it only works ok, it's so cute it will make up for all the problems."

Since then I have read, watched and listened carefully -- Holmes-like -- to all things Sherlock.  Sometimes pleased (the early Britt portrayals) sometimes disgusted (Robert Downey, Jr, need I say more?) I have hungered and thirsted for the real Sherlock.  And here he is, in his full and real glory, on the trail of the bad guys, making progress from the slightest of clues, adding two and two and getting the real answer, not the four I get with the evidence.  This is the real Holmes in the real London with the real characters we knew and loved but with devilishly new crimes to stop and perplexing trails to follow.

Sherlock has passed away and Watson is both elderly and failing in health. Twenty five years have passed since the events he is writing about. Even so, he knows that this case was so sensitive that it is still not time for it to be published. He intends that it be held for one hundred years before publication."
6022,1409133826,ROXDBKSIO4OR,Very well done indeed!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020",,,"Anthony Horowitz does an amazing job capturing the Victorian era of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his wonderful characters.  Watson and Holmes are portrayed just as if this was written by the pen of Conan Doyle.  This story is very true to form and even the plotting is very similar to the original author's, but you will find that the story is a bit more graphic and puts the famous detective into some very tricky and dangerous situations.  When a man comes to see Sherlock at 221B Baker Street asking him to find an Irish man who had terrorized him on his recent trip to America and followed him back home to England.  This request puts Holmes and Watson on an extremely dangerous journey that unearths some very powerful men, and the abhorrent secrets that they will stop at nothing to protect.  Horowitz does a  truly remarkable job of creating this mystery and its realistic atmosphere.  Highly entertaining.  It was a pleasant surprise as I felt that I was reading a newly found story by the great man himself."
6023,1409133826,R3OBJEQVO7A5CD,"A decent mystery, a decent story, a decent pastiche, and a decent diversion",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2019",,,"I don't really read too many Sherlock Holmes pastiches, because the stories are never really as fulfilling as those by the master.  Still, there are some decent ones, like Meyer's <i>Seven-Percent Solution</i>, and this one by British screenwriter and author Anthony Horowitz is pretty good.  There are some issues.  It is very long, even compared to Doyle's longest Holmes novel, and thus it sticks out for that reason.  Sometimes this novel sounds like a Holmes story, sometimes he is too in-depth and artsy.  At times, the conceit that this is Watson writing in his dotage and retirement is strained by the excessive detail.  Watson never described extraneous details so thoroughly as Horowitz does, and probably wouldn't decades after the event.  For instance, at random, p. 180: ""The kitchen knife laying on the table, the soup bubbling on the hearth, the brace of pheasants hanging from a hook in the pantry, Kirby casting eyes downwards, his wife standing with her hands on her apron, Patrick still smiling....""  Do we really believe Watson would have written this scene in any story of the Canon, even if he wrote it right after the event, much less decades after the event?  Watson never was so loquacious and descriptive, especially with pointless details for characters that are just added to divert attention and add to the suspect list.  Still, it is a decent mystery, a decent story, a decent pastiche, and a decent diversion."

Very soon, three cases engage Holmes’ attention.  First, art dealer Edmund Carstairs, asks Holmes to find the man who has apparently been following him.  He suspects the man of being Keelan O’Donaghue, the surviving member of a gang of thieves who destroyed (accidentally) a shipment of paintings he had sent to an American client.  And, it appears, this man has broken into his home and stolen a family heirloom necklace.  With the assistance of the street urchins dubbed the Baker Street Irregulars (especially Wiggins and Ross), Holmes traces the necklace to a pawn shop, and follows that up by tracking down the apparent thief—whom he finds murdered in a cheap boarding house."

Horowitz imitates the language and superficial style of Doyle very well and with some wit.  Even though there were relatively few surprises for me, that was probably because I've read too many Horowitz books in a row and too many mysteries in general.  By the ratings it receives, I'm clearly in a minority that way."

I had not read any of Boyd's novels before, and was not certain about this book for the first 20 pages or so.  But the more I read the more it gripped me, and I am likely to go on to read more of his books.  The twin stories interleaved chapter by chapter made for an interesting approach to the telling of the main story, and the contrasting atmospheres of the two very different eras - World War 2 and 1970s Oxford - were well captured.  There was more depth to the wartime story - but then it was the main one - and its denouement was good.  And while there was less flesh to some of the Oxford story and its characters, for me that mattered less as the main interest was the developing understanding of the 2 primary characters and the interaction between them."

There’s a clever plot that weaves together two mysteries, memorable characters, and puzzles. What surprised me was that my favorite parts were where Horowitz carefully colored outside the lines in the narration—reflecting on the humanitarian problem of childhood poverty in London in 1890, which the Baker Street Irregulars brings up, but Conan Doyle never “saw” because it was simply part of the backdrop of his life. Horowitz also spares quick, more compassionate asides for characters like Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, remarking that while she appears in his narratives, he regrets never taking the time to know her. I thought these “blindspots” Horowitz has the sensitivity to see were quite touching and made the novel something better than just another mystery."

The prose of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sweeps the reader along delightfully and effortlessly. This, on the other hand,  is something of a slow trudge.  The author has a penchant for strange, distracting word choices that he apparently believes make his writing more ""authentic"". As other reviewers have noted, he seems to have striven to sprinkle elements from almost every one of the original stories throughout.  His Watson is a doggedly devoted caricature and Holmes rather weak and irrational. Nonetheless, it's an interesting mystery, but I wonder if the only reason it was ""officially approved by the Conan Doyle estate"" is that it's the only one ever to apply. I've certainly read better."

I think it's safe to say his adventures are timeless, if at times more satisfying for the byplay between Watson and Holmes than the actual mystery.

Dozens of later adventures of the Great Detective have been written, some of them deliberate send-ups (usually not very successfully), and many placing Holmes and Watson in new situations that would never have occurred to Sir Arthur. The most interesting of the many I’ve read of these over the years was probably Nicholas Meyer’s _The Seven-Per-Cent Solution_ (1974), which brings in Sigmund Freud, but it wasn’t very close to the flavor of the original. (And the Robert Duvall film two years later was absolutely dreadful.)"

It is very, very rare that I’ve enjoyed any author’s reboot of a classical series or work of literature. Sherlock Holmes has been especially abused, from what I’ve read. However, the combination of some good reviews and a good deal on the book convinced me to give The House of Silk a try. I enjoyed it thoroughly."

He goes into absurd amounts of detail about every entry room, courthouse, canal that they pass through and offers a page-long preamble on every new character's clothing and comportment.  This might mirror Holmes' deductive abilities, but it distracts from the main selling point of the novel: the actual mystery.  The book finally picks up in the last 60 or so pages, offering two conclusions which while clever do not feel like they warrant an entire novel's worth.  As an exercise in continuing Conan Doyle's writing style, The House of Silk is a moderate success.  As a page turning whodunnit, it lacks substance."

We even dropped it out of one of our fourth  floor hotel room windows (accedentally, of corse), and it still plays  beautifully.  And it doesn't suck up as much power as my first Panasonic  one did.  I'd definitly say that you should buy this one.  It's cheap, and  it's just as good as my friend's $130 Sony one (at least, about 7 of us  thought so).

It  survived these drops (and not to mention people hitting it to test its esp)  without even a scratch. I think there may be a difference in reliability  between the car version and regular version, because all the reviews that  say they got the car kit version are good reviews, and also read the  D-E456CK reviews as well to back this up.  I can use it in my pocket  walking without esp on and it won't skip. the only thing ESP would be  needed for is to keep it from skipping while you are trying to damage and  break it. plus it sounds better with the esp off.

I remember them, in the way one remembers loved stories, and of course have seen the movies and the tv show. I say this to point out that the tone and wording and some of the nuance of the original works are things I have perhaps forgotten. So I cannot say with any conviction that someone who has read the original stories in the past week would not find fault with the tone and wording and nuance found in The House of Silk. I can only say that I found no fault in them. Anthony Horowitz is the author blessed by the Conan Doyle Estate to continue expanding the Holmes canon, and I am happy with their choice."

For most of the time, it is possible to believe the book was written by Conan Doyle, the master storyteller, himself. All the regular characters are there - Inspector Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, brother Mycroft - and as a Holmes fanatic, I wasn't conscious of any of those jarring inconsistencies that mar many a Holmes tribute. The plot is complex and well written, and we see Holmes both as the calculating thinker and as the man of action. The Holmes/Watson relationship is very faithfully portrayed."

Horowitz clearly knows the Holmes canon and perfectly sets this novel within Conan Doyle's work, possibly during ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"" or immediately following ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", though there is a possible reference to ""The Adventure of the Dying Detective"" from ""His Last Bow"". In any event, Horowitz effortlessly evokes the spirit and feel of Conan Doyle's original work."

The Audio Manager software  shipped with the Rio never did work fully for me. I tried on two different  machines.  There is no way to even understand some of the Rio500 features  from the material shipped, or from their web site. Although eMail questions  are answered in about 24 hours, after a week of ongoing frustration I  discovered MusicMatch. I tried Real Jukebox, but suggest downloading the  free version of MusicMatch software from MusicMatch.com to use for  downloading files and for ripping CDs for use with the Rio500.  I found it  to work intuitively and easly almost from the beginning.  You will also  need to down load the free plug in from MusicMatch to enable downloading to  the Rio device. After installing Jukebox, then go to the Jukebox tab on the  website, then to plugins. I will cheerfully upgrade MusicMatch and send  them my money even though the free version is fully functional and more  than satisfactory."

It is a new product, yet when compared to its unique features gets a high rating from me. I do use the RIO for music when walking, etc. However I have found it very valuable  to me as an education cram machine. I bought a series of videos on SQL7  Database certification. Most of the instruction is audio (90%) which lends  itself to the RIO audio player. What I do is digitally record each chapter  as a .WAV file about 10 to 18 minutes each. I use soundforge software. I  normalize to -10db. Then noisefilter the gaps for silence. I then do a time  compression of about 30%; this seems to work the best, then convert the  .WAV to .MP3 at 32 bits mono. This is about the lowest bit-rate before it  sounds like Darth Vader. I am getting about a 1-10 file size reduction and  30% time reduction before loading to the RIO. I can load 4 hours of clean,  clear voice instructions in one package. I play it when I walk, in my car  and other free listening time. Great educational aid!"

I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.

6298,142720019X,R2KOYBMDKUBR59,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 22, 2007",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"One of Boyd's best novels. Elegently written, mixing events which happened in the early 80s to a woman who surprisingly discovered her mother used to be a British spy in WWII with the narrative of HOW she was recruited and ultimately betrayed by her boss, who proceeds to become a British Lord. The sentences Boyd uses are beautiful, the situations and references to England during the 80s and her travels through Europe, Canada and USA in the tail-end of the war are well-constructed. Loved it!!"

6300,142720019X,RYML3LC4T2EXG,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 31, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"All praise to the person who wrote the screenplay for the two part TV adaptation. It was better, tighter and more suspenseful than the book. That said, it wasn't quite faithful to Boyd's characterisation of Eva. The young Eva in the TV version, played by the pulchritudinous Hayley Atwell was portrayed as an innocent girl who had to grow up at a spectacular pace when becoming a spy whereas the Eva of the book was already a shrewd and more believable 29 year old when recruited. The Charlotte Rampling portrayal of the older Eva (circa 1976)is more like the book's character and you could readily believe that she is a wary former spy who has lived in hiding for over 30 years. There are other differences; in the book, Eva didn't disappear after a blitz shootout, she didn't escape with a colleague to Canada but went alone, Eva didn't kill the unit's communications specialist, much was made of an irrelevant quasi relationship between Eva's daughter and an Iranian dissident and her sheltering of Baader-Meinhof squatters. These were not in the TV adaptation and for good reason."

(See the horrid recent attempt by a modern author to write as Agatha Christie in a new novel called The Monogram Murders, it was awful!) In fact, had I known that this was what The House of Silk *was*, I would never have picked it up. But I didn't get to read the blurb because it was an audiobook that I quickly downloaded from my library website before I took off overseas for vacation and by the time I figured out what was going on (first paragraph), I had no internet connection to download another book. And all I can say is: Thank the literary Gods for that! Because I was in for one of the biggest reading treats ever!"

But Horowitz did a great job, balancing two seemingly unrelated mysteries and bringing them, and a host of related complications, together. The writing let me guess some of the story, while hiding the rest from me. The resolution was very satisfying. A cozy winter read in front of the fire."

The main downside for me is the lack of free books/special offers that Amazon does for the Kindle. B&N just doesn't have as many good deals or as often. Aside from that, highly recommend!"

I believe the VCR+ function is no longer available.The S-VHS recordings and ET recordings look really great but will not play back on a standard VHS machine. They only play back on S-VHS machines that record and playback these special recorded tapes. Standard VHS tapes recorded in the regular VHS mode on this machine should have no problem playing back on another VHS machine.

Now I can have just one wire (s-video) going to my TV.  The JVC VCR has a nice feature in that when you change channels up/down, included in the list is  Line-1 (where I input from my dish).  So, after the highest TV channel it  just goes to the dish input -- nice!  I don't need the TV remote except to  turn the thing on.  Also, any time I want to play a tape, I just put in a  tape and run it and it just takes over the TV picture.  The instructions  were not clear on the 'plug/play' hookup.  It didn't seem to be working but  I left it alone for a while and it was OK.  It just needed to find the time  signal from my local PBS station which is only sent once per hour -- I hope  that's helpful. I haven't tried it with an S-VHS tape.  A complaint I have  is that when useing S-VHS ET with a regular VHS tape, there is no indicator  that shows the quality that it allowed itself to record at.  One could  argue that one could just observe the tape, post recording.  However, I'd  like to try a tape to see if that important movie will record on *that*  tape in a high quality."

One reason  that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well  with my other JVC components, but the remote is awkward to use with my TV  and DBS.

Interestingly enough it also deals with the question of boredom: What would you do if you had all the time in the world and no one to talk to? The extra stories at the end are quite short and look more like aborted attempts at novels, skim read over them, one or two are worth a read.

At face value, it's a spy story, but given the quality of Boyd's narrative, characters and plotting, it's a true cut above most in the genre. Boyd, I think, likes to play with his readers and challenge them to think beyond the fare words on the page. So there's a bit of a conundrum around Eve in this story. The plotting is intricate with a few historical facts woven into the overall detail. Gives it a really authentic feel. The characters gave depth and intelligence, so there's food for thought along the way."

6485,B00000JSGF,R9M4FYAFDAH7R,The end of mp3 handhelds? I think not,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2000",,,"What some electronics fans will have you believe about mp3 players is that they are too expensive and they have been beaten by the CD. This is hardly the case. While the CD is able to hold large amounts of DATA it is only  able to hold about 74mins of music. This is of course unless you'd rather  burn MP3s onto the CD, which cannot be read by your average CD player. So  forget anything you've heard about CDs being able to hold astronomical  amounts of music. Another factor that plagues the CD medium is that CDs are  easily damaged. I don't care how much ESP your CD player has it cannot fix  scratches. Obviously MP3s cannot be scratched. Next there is the time  issue. It takes the average CD burner anywhere from 30-60mins to burn a  full music CD. A MP3 player with USB support such as this one can download  a full hour of music in about 10 mins. Then, as if I needed to continue,  there is the permanence of CDs. Yes I know there are new re-writeable CDs  but the burners that support them are pricey. Traditionally once you burn a  CD, listen to a few times and become bored with it you can either use it as  a coaster or trash it. There is not permanence with MP3 handhelds. I hope I  have convinced all of you CD die-hards that the CD (soon to be followed by  the MD) is on the way out the door while MP3 handhelds are checking real  estate."

It is a wonderful product, here's why : What do you strive for in a MP3 player ? Good sound, Space for music, compactness, cool look, competitive pricing, and I can honestly say that  the Rio 500 meets each of these qualities. The sound is barely  distinguishable from a true CD. Unless your are a true audiophile you will  not be able to tell the difference, UNLESS you like listening to music  REALLY LOUD, then you might be able too find a small distortion in the MP3  version. The 500 can also hold a lot of songs, because it is 64 Megs and  also you can transfer your songs because of its USB connection. It looks  great! It is also the size of a pager. AND IT DOESN'T SKIP! This product is  worth its price. This maybe the last ""pure mp3"" model available  because after christmas the SDIC will be putting a detector which won't let  you download free mp3's unless explicity stated by the musician. SO GET EM  NOW! It only takes one AA batteria for 12 hrs of playback which is pretty  good. The LCD is a very nice neon blue. The only problem with this product  are the bad earphones. Contrary to one of the reviewers I believe it is  quite easy to install. I didn't read the manual. Just plug it into your USB  port ( IMPORTANT YOU NEED A USB PORT TO RUN IT )and then windows  automatically asks you for the driver cd, then you pop it in restart your  computer and Viola! Don't ponder the value of this product too long because  before you know it they will be Sold OUT! Happy Listening! Cheers"

I got a refurbished model on Ebay for a resonsable price for recording concerts over the summer.  This is a great model, durable and very shock resistant.  I purchased a binaural microphone after I recorded a couple shows on a cheaper mono and man what a difference.  One major tip if you are starting to record with the MZ-R37 - be sure to hold the record button in place and be sure recording has commenced, I missed some songs at gigs because the recorder didn't start.  Better to be safe than sorry.  Anyway, this is also great for recording MP3s off of your computer just get a connection line from your sound card to the line in and you are set.  You can also transfer concert recordings or band demos onto you computer if you have a recordable sound card.  Great investment.  Forget about MP3 players, too expensive to add memory.  Minidiscs are inexpensive and far more durable than CDs also, with identical sound quality.  If you are a music fan I don't know how you could live without one."

This minidisc player is such a great benefit that any music lover or electronics enthusiast (sorry for the spelling) should enjoy. With this gadget I was able to record from everything and it saved me a lot of money. I didnt have to buy cds to listen to one song. I would just borrow from friends or family and record the track or  tracks that I liked and return the cd to them. The sound was incredible. I no longer have to worry about not being able to listen to cds because they're scratched, because when I put it on minidisc, its impossible for the cd inside to  get scratched. Another plus is it does not skip. There are so many positives about the minidisc player that I can go on forever. Its like having a cd burner in your pocket. However despite the positives, it has its downfalls. The buttons are really small and I jammed my skip search button. It cost 50 dollars to get it fixed. I would definately recommend getting a warranty. Also this one eats batterys fast. It takes only 15 hours on 2 batterys. I think  its definately great and I enjoy this player."

It is sturdy yet compact.  The newer models I have seen don't seem as durable as this model.  2.) I can make my own ""mix tapes"" thousands of times over because MD's are re-recordable without losing audio quality.  Also I can take my favorite songs from CDs and put them on one disc instead of lugging around several CDs.  3.) I can record from any audio source.  Download from the internet and make your own MD without investing in blank CDs.  4.) The batteries last forever, or seemingly forever.  I listen on long road trips (8 hours +) and seldom need lots of extra batteries.  5.) It's so easy to use that I am able to use it.  6.) I have never had any problems with it.  I have even dropped it on the ground (accidentally) a few times and nothing has been damaged on the inside, or outside  7.) It's less bulky than a portable CD player."

He reintroduced favorites like Lestrade, the Baker Street Irregulars and even Mycroft Holmes. (And offered us a nice take on Dr. Watson true thoughts of Lestrade.)  And unlike some reviews I've read criticizing his writing style and in particular the interaction between Holmes and his brother, I thought both were reminiscent of the original novels (which I just recently re-read for the first time in probably twenty years)."

It may lack an FM radio or organizer like others have but the same and its quality make up for that.  If you want an FM player I suggest getting a Walkman by Sony or Aiwa.  Audible is now compatible with  the Rio and has many interesting types of audible content.  I have  personally used my Rio in other ways than in my ears.  I have hooked up an  optional Rio-to-cassette adapter, which you may already have or have to  purchase, and listen to it in the car or in a stereo system.  The  software is the best of its class.  If I'm not mistaken I'm sure it uses  Winamp technology for it's sound, which makes it well worth it to listen to  it on your computer too (the Rio 500's quality is just as good if not  better).  My collection of MP3s ranges over 200 so I advise anyone  who gets this and has a vast variety of enjoyable music or audible content  to have 1+GB of space available on your system.  That's nothing for newer  systems.  The Rioport software which is included allows you to:  rip tracks off of CDs, burn copies of Cds if you have a CD-Rewritable  Drive, have a playist, copy songs to your Rio, browse the Internet, convert  MP3s to .WAV format, etc.  I would highly suggest having an Internet  connection as it is very helpful.  Also the headphones on this  piece of equipment can blast up to wazoo and its max is way to high for  anyone's ears. Thats more used for auxilary output anyway.  The menu on it  is easy to use yet I would suggest keeping your Rio up to date.  When you  buy your Rio it comes with 64 MB of space on it.  You can store 1 song up  to about 40 depending on the bitrate (ex: 64 kb/sec, 128 kb/sec).  When you open the box you get as follows: A USB cable, the Rio 500(which  has a back lit display so you can see it when it gets dark and read the  track info and other info), the earphones, a user's manual, coupons for  online music related stuff, a small case that can be clipped to your  pants/belt (yet the Rio is so small it fits in your pocket).  If  you want to listen to more songs you can buy smart media cards... and add on an  extra 1-20 songs proportional to the bitrate.  Your songlist on the  Rio is dynamic (changing) which means you can delete and add songs at any  time.  If you are a music lover this is for you.  Oh I forgot, THE  MUSIC NEVER SKIPS because there are no moving parts.  Believe me it is a  must!"

Battery life is about the same as my old Rio 300, but it's shorter if you use headphones with in-line volume control. I've upgraded it with a 64meg smartmedia card, and at 32k/sec bitrate I can have over 130 songs available. At 32k the sound quality is satisfactory and I'd rather have a large variety than CD-quality. The Rio 300 allowed a 24k bitrate but the lowest on the Rio 500 is 32k. The backlight, bookmarks and random play modes are also great features. I don't use the equalizer very often. I also listen to audiobooks from an online site, where I got my Rio 500. The sound quality is usually okay, but due to a slow modem I have to download the lowest available quality. The higher quality files are huge but would probably sound much better. The bookmarking feature on the Rio is great for audiobooks as it allows you to easily resume listening after an interruption. I do have two complaints about the Rio. One is the plastic carrying case which makes it difficult to use the side controls for bookmarking, volume, etc. But it is move convenient to just slide the clasp over my jeans pocket instead of putting it inside a pocket. Secondly, the RioPort software is very clunky when compared to MusicMatch Jukebox or WinAmp. But there are several replacements available at another online site, I usually use Riorio or Riositude. You can search for either name and find the software."

6570,B00000JSGF,R3M2UELROC0O1O,Perfect for audible books,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2000",3 people found this helpful,,"I use my Rio for audible books, not MP3, but I must say it's fantastic.  Amazon apparently doesn't carry it anymore but it was Amazon that sent me an email directing me to audible.com to buy it there.  The unit was(...) [inexpensive] after rebate. The sound is wonderful because they included a free bonus cassette player adapter so I can listen in the car w/out headphones.  The loud pops refered to in a previous review can only happen if the Rio is set at its highest volume and the cassette player at its lowest.  A little common sense and patience is required when you buy any new gadget.  The software included is very easy to use.  The Rio 500 is easy to carry and use and the 64MB is upgradeable to 128 which is hardly necessary since the 64 holds about 30 hours of reading material.  I thought it was a pretty sweet deal considering the price of the unit and now the ability to download audiobooks at a fraction of the price and no bulky tapes to lug around."

6576,B00000JXV1,REVJYTVOI60BV,A true workhorse in a dying breed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2000",25 people found this helpful,,"It is hard to believe just how cheap stereo VCR's are getting, only a few years ago you couldn't find one for less then $250 and now they are starting at under $150.  In the past I have had the oppertunity to use several differant brands of VCR's and have had nothing but trouble.  I have  had a Panasonic VCR that in less than a year went into the repair shop  twice because a tape had gotten stuck in the unit.  I've had a Magnavox VCR  that didn't even last a year and a half. I've also used a Toshiba, and  another Panasonic unit at my former work, and I must say that they were two  of the most tempermental video units that I've ever used. This Sony unit  (that I just got) is similar to my other Sony (SLV-675HF) that is almost 3  years old now.  In the three years that I've had my Sony VCR, I have never  had a problem with it.  It is easy to use, program, and if you can't set  the clock you must be stupid.  The picture has always been great (for VHS,  I prefer the quality of DVD), and it records like a champ.  The remote is  one of the best I've used, the only thing that would make it better is  backlighting (but that's just nitpicking).  If you need a new VCR, buy a  SONY.  In a weird side story, both my sister and I bought new VCR's the  same week.  She got a more expensive Hitachi, and I got my beloved Sony,  and of the two units the Sony is the better performer."

Its a jewel and meets all my expectations while listening to my cassett tapes while working out in the health club on the cardio equipment. It has an antirolling mechanism and auto tape reverse. I do like wearing a 1"" cloth belt to hold this in place on my lower back so Im completely hands free and unobstructed of the headphone cord when Im running. I prefer to wear my Dr. Dre headphones instead of the ones that come with this. I also use the radio too to listen to a Sat football game or local FM stations. Love the sound quality and agree with the other postive reviews that are spot on in describing how good this Walkman is."

The unit is very small, but also very sturdy.  I believe the body of the unit is metal, not cheap plastic.  Do not mistake these for the cheaper Sony portable audio products that seem to be geared for teenagers.  This is a sophisticated, well-made device.  It comes with a folding headset, Sony Nickel Cadmium rechargeable batteries, remote control, power adapter, and an optical cable.  The unit has the capability to recharge the batteries when it is plugged in to an outlet.  For recordings, I suggest using the power adapter instead of running on battery power.  An excellent Sony product.  I highly recommend it if you can find it here or ebay.  I have been using and enjoying mine for over 2 years."

Generally I used the output of the sound reinforcement system (tho I made a lot of very good recordings with the included stereo mic).  The quality is excellent.  I've been able to use many tunes recorded on the MD for CD's.  Yes it's THAT good."

This model is easy and fun to use. I bought this Mini Disc player/recorder because I needed something to listen to at work, but didn't want a tape player due to the fact that one has to stop working to flip the tape all the time. I can put a lot of music and audio books on one mini disc. It is built like a tank and I can recharge the batteries without taking the batteries out. I got the recharge batteries and A/C power adapter at Radio Shack. Recording from my stereo is a snap. I can't understand why Mini Disc players and mini discs aren't more accepted here in the U.S.A. The advantages mini discs have over CD's are huge."

This product is for you. Not only can you easily record MP3 using a mini-jack cable from the back of your sound card you can easily  record CDs using a mini-jack to rca cable if you have an older stereo, or  use the optical cable provided for perfect digital recordings. I finally  have a product with the capabilities of making a mix of CD and MP3 music on  CHEAP rewritable 74 minute media. MD media costs around 2-5 dollars a disc.  This item is so versatile I don't see why anyone doesn't buy it. My only  concern is the lack of a LCD display on the headphone remote, but I can  deal with it. I have not been able to make this thing skip no matter how  hard I try. Plus it's great for bootlegging concerts with a tiny little  microphone attached. Buy this item, you won't be sorry at all."

6638,142720019X,R1PPNYNOFMAIB8,,,"Reviewed in France on March 16, 2007",4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This book, constructed around two characters and two stories - one during WW2 involving a young woman who works as a spy and the other in the 70s with her daughter who finds out about her mother's past - is not very well balanced. The 1940s part is somewhat interesting, but the hippy-era bit is quite unsatisfactory, with lots of dangling ends and unfinished business. Overall I found that the book lacks depth in characterization and background."

""No one!  NO ONE!  Are you listening Eva, trust no one""!- that this reader concluded at once that Romer is the one she shouldn't have trusted.  All that remained was the when, where, why and how of his betrayal of her.  I have the feeling that Mr. Boyd didn't want to tell Eva's story in its actual time frame - because there would then be too long a gap between her flight from Canada and her confrontation with Romer during which time she does no more than ""watch her back"" - and pick herself a husband so that her Russian name ""disappears"".  So the daughter - the vessel into which Eva's story is poured - is introduced.  The problem here is that her 2 German squatters and her  Iranian would-be lover suggest more interesting plot lines than Eva dodging in and out of  department store elevators.  But these sub-plots come to nothing."

Except for the fact that the book seems to center a bit more on Watson than it does Holmes, I thought the author (Horowitz) did a fantastic job emulating Doyle's style and character. I suspected the true meaning of the House of Silk, as I have read several of Anne Perry's books dealing with the seamier side of the Victorian age, but the ride getting to its full conclusion in this book was riveting. I've read some of the less flattering reviews of this book, and while I can appreciate that we all wish that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had written another 200 stories or novels about Sherlock Holmes, it's not going to happen. As a substitute, this book is exciting and a true tribute to the original."

I just finished it and absolutely loved it. Horowitz has done a marvelous job of capturing the characters and the writing style of Doyle. And yet he has added his own style to Doyle's to make an absolutely wonderful mystery of the first order. I would recommend this book to mystery lovers and Holmes lovers as well. I am on to the next in the series and am delighted to find an author whose works I can look forward to reading when he publishes a new book."

I adore Sherlock Holmes, had read every one of the works in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canon by the time I was 15, and have read dozens of other modern authors who have taken up the mantle. Horowitz is the best. it's the Holmes you love, impeccably wrought, flawed but not unbearable (looking at you Cumberbatch!), and still possessed of the flawless eye and nineteenth-century detection methods. However, Horowitz has given us a thoroughly modern mystery that is more complex and interesting anything Doyle wrote. I just want him to write a ton more."

I’d go as far as to say it’s as good as Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Holmes stories. And just like in Horowitz’s follow-up, MORIARTY, the reveal at the end of the book is superb. As for that follow-up book, I can’t help but feel slightly disappointed that it wasn’t a proper Watson/Holmes adventure. After reading THE HOUSE OF SILK, I wanted more of the same, and MORIARTY definitely isn’t that. It’s certainly every bit as good as its predecessor, but with side characters replacing the famous duo. I just hope Horowitz can be persuaded to give us a third Sherlock Holmes novel—preferably one featuring the man himself."

I was surprised at how well the author captured Doyle's metre, flow and pace while doing so in a modern more adult method more befitting both today's reader and the real people of that era.  Horowitz did not try to dumb it down to a mild plot nor put the language back to the 5th grade. Doyle didn't do that either but he wrote for the Victorian era and we are not in Kansas any more, Toto. People do use profanity today and also did in the late 1800's as well, for example. Plus the plots were pretty bloody and horrible in real life as they are today. Recall Jack the Ripper?  Those were ugly murders and they didn't try to hide their horror in the papers like we may tend to do more of today or act like they did back then. ""The House of Silk"" is written in Victorian speech but as it was rather than how we often tend to dainty it up to have been. Funny, Doc Holliday can cuss and that is fine but not a British cop of the same era."

Next you must download  Audible.com's AudibleManager - the software that ships with the Rio doesn't  upload the Audible.com sound files themselves. The software (RioPort) was  my biggest complaint... after I registered the 2.x version that comes with  the Rio500 (gotta register the 2.x version FIRST), I upgraded to the 3.x  version. Works okay... but some tracks seem to be getting stuck in the  middle of downloading tracks to the MP3 player (RioPort just freezes up).

This upgrade to  the firmware is important, since without it the rio is unable to use 64mb  flash cards. The only problem I have with the Rio is the lack of  instructions that come with the unit. They only give you a small fold out  which does not explain enough in my opinion. After a  few abortive tries I  was finally able to upload songs to the Rio. The sound quality was  excellent. The headphones are not that great and I recommend you start  looking for new ones as soon as the Rio arrives."

I tryed to delete it but it just stayed on. So i downloaded the software to fotmatt the whole thing and upgraded the OS. When I was done boom. It had a black screen everytime I turned it on and would not stop. The only way was too download more software too get rid of the black screen. It worked. Then it came back. I ran the software again and It did not work again again and again. My computer froze everytime because once it restarted the rio it was waiting for a resonce. Because it did not work it never got a responce. So I ignored it thinking it will go away some day. I turned it on then it still had it. I contaced rio and then they said WE DO NOT SUPPORT THAT MP3 PLAYER ANY MORE. SO I never got it repired. Now took it apart and had fun torchering it. Now it is a beat up little electionic that does not work in my closet. I blame it on the Rio and the person [on line] that gave me the MP3.

It is a very fast, action-packed read, and Horowitz perfectly captures the characters and ambiance of a good Holmes story. But, I was disappointed at the ending. It seems like Horowitz weaved and weaved a complex story, multiple angles, characters and action coming out of nowhere, and then got to the point where he had to come up with an (what he thought needs to be an explosive) ending to pull it all together. He does do this, but it seems contrived and I don't believe the conclusion. It seems far too pulled out of the 21st Century and doesn't fit the Holmes era or do Conan Doyle justice. The ending could have been much simpler and that much better. Oh well, better luck next time I guess."

I love the original Doyle stories (wrote my Master's thesis on them in fact), and I felt that the Horowitz's style was not as similar to Doyle's as the critics would have you believe. The characterization was poorly done - Watson was extremely unintelligent at times, Holmes oddly sentimental and emotional, Mycroft frustratingly unhelpful, and Moriarty was completely unnecessary. Watson's continued ineptitude especially frustrated me to no end. There were so many references to canon stories that, though I appreciated them at first, really dragged the pace of the narrative down after a while."

First, there's the subject matter.  Then there's the tone--occasionally I thought I could hear echoes of Watson but, in general, no. On the plus side I found the story sufficiently interesting to have actually finished it.  On the other hand the story did not strike me as authentically Sherlockian.  Perhaps worse, I figured out the ""mystery"" very early on, the first time the big clue is dropped, and if we assume that I'm not all that clever then neither is what is going on here.  I have no idea what is entailed in getting the approval of the Conan Doyle estate to write a contemporary Sherlock Holmes story but it sure isn't great writing."

I love almost all the Sherlock Holmes pastiche type books that are written in the style of A. C. Doyle. My favorite are the Laurie King books about Mary Russell. This book was OK, nothing very exciting happened though. There is an very elaborate mystery to solve and Holmes and Watson do a good job as usual.

This is not terrible pastiche. By the same token, neither is it the second coming of Doyle. Essentially, The House of Silk is good pastiche that is reasonably well written and intelligent, but which appears to suffer in places from careless editing and lack of dilligence from the author. One example has Watson referring to a murder from earlier in the tale as a shooting when in fact it was a stabbing. The Moriarty cameo also struck me as ultimately useless, which is uncharacteristic of a genius like Moriarty."

Without giving too much away the novel concerns 2 interconnecting mysteries, the main mystery has Holmes and Watson facing real evil but not Dracula or Jack the Ripper or any other supernatural entity, as we've seen Holmes face in the last several years, but the type of evil that one could easily find today.  This is a fascinating book and without giving too much away, the evil Holmes faces in ""The House of Silk"" probably could not have been written about in a Sherlock Holmes novel actually written by Conan Doyle.

But for the price your paying for this, you could get a great Mini Disk player, and even plenty of discs for over 6,000 minutes of recording time with the same sound quality!  Dont believe me? Goto the Mini Disc section and do the math! Even better,  you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your  voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape,  everything!  I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's  are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk  trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago. They are  already making Mini Disk drives fro computers to store info. Just check out  the Mini Disks before you buy this, trust me, you'll thank me.

It is light, smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible (audio books) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly, with a checkerboard screen].  A quick search at Rio's website (rioworld.org) revealed a recovery utility, which I ran and recovered my Rio's firmware.  Whew!"

AWESOME. I'm gonna buy my first memory card tonight.  Never really needed it.  As long as you put songs 3 minutes or under, you can get quite a bit of music on it.  Right now I have 14 tracks ranging from 6 minutes 1:25 (on average 3 min).  I love it for running...small, light weight...unlike walkmans or portable CD players.  The case is very protective (don't worry about dropping, it won't be phased) and has a clip which is very sturdy--holds in place even with loose running shorts while running!  Turn off backlight to conserve battery (as with all electronics).  I've never used the bookmark.  Random feature is great for speeding up the download time (don't have to organize order to seperate songs by the same artist).  Rio software is easy and fairly quick.  CD quality sound as far as I'm concerned, only better cuz there's no skipping.  Head phones are good, but I've found louder(not necessarily better).  They thinly and conveniently wrap around your ear to stay on your head and leave your hair free.  Nice style, compact size.  If you plan on going on long trips and don't like listenting to the same songs over and over, a minidisk player is probably better.  This was a gift from a person who did a lot of research at the time and said it was the best on the market.  And by the way, Rio's were also the first!"

If you need details, read on:  I bought the Diamond Rio 500 because I like to listen to  music while working out.  I currently own a Panasonic Shock Wave tape  player which I listen to at the gym.  I was very dissapointed with the  Diamond Rio when I received it.  Quite frankly, my tape player sounds  better (sure, there's more static, but the bass is definitely better).  Also, the Diamond Rio software is horrible.  Thankfully, I have Real  Jukebox software which I used to download music to the player.  Another  major reason I disliked the Diamond Rio is that it doesn't have a belt clip  on the back.  You must put the player into a carrying case in order to  attach it to a belt or waist strap.  The carrying case has a clear plastic  cover which covers the player's controls, but the volume control is the  worst design yet.  The volume control also serves other functions that  become available if you press the volume control in.  The problem is, every  time I attempted to adjust the volume, the other functions would be  selected instead of the volume.  It is a huge pain in the neck. This  product is definitely not worth $200.00.  My advise to the manufacturer is  to forget the carrying case, improve the sound and headphones, attach a  belt clip, and make the volume control ONLY A VOLUME CONTROL.  The only  good thing about the Diamond Rio is how quickly music downloads to the  player."

With a Minidisc  player/recorder, you can get (for approximately the same price) a machine  with a cheaper recordable medium (A SmartMedia card costs $80 for a 32MB  card...whereas a 74 minute Minidisc is $2) a higher audio quality, and you  can record from not only your computer but also any digital/analog source.

Sound output is just as good as a CD player.  After spending time researching, I found that this was the only mp3 player that could support over 64MB of memory, which is an advantage over other  mp3 players because you don't have to constantly switch fragile memory  cards to get another hour of music.  With updates that can be downloaded  from diamond's website, the rio500 can now support 64MB of external memory,  so the player can have a total of 128MB of memory, which is more than  anything out there.  (The flash-ROM is useful in quickly and easily  updating the rio).  I had no problems installing the software.  And  downloading songs to the player is incredibly fast.  With a download rate  of 0.5MB per second, it takes just 4 minutes to fill 128MB of memory.  The  built-in equilizer is useful in boosting bass and treble.  The adjustable  backlight it very bright.  It also includes random and repeat play modes,  as well as some other progroming functions.  A bookmark feature is useful  for listening to books.  My only complaint is that the software is  confusing to use at first.  Oh, and also buy better headphones along with  the Rio, since the earbuds it comes with are basically junk. With its tiny  size, sleek design, and good quality, it's well worth the $200 pricetag."

The mp3 player  itself looks sleek and cool. The software was really easy to use... you can  just figure it out with out reading any help topics or manuals. although  the software could use a little help, it's just fine the way it is.  transfering the mp3s is really easy too.

I am a senior in high school and, with one of these players, you will have a very good day. At first the software seemed quirky and i  had to reboot every now and then to get the USB to work. After I did some  ""spring cleaning"" to my computer and put a fresh version of  windows on the HardDrive it now works without any flaws. Also the software  seems to be a pain because it attempts to add every mp3 it can find on the  main harddrive to the library and then it selects every mp3 in the library,  so when you go to send files to the rio500 you have to deselect every file  you don't want. Or delete the mp3's one at a time from the library. There  is no deselect all and the delete and backspace buttons don't do the job.  If you are lucky enough to have a ""Drop down menu"" button on your  keyboard you can remove files rapidly. No compliants about the player  whatsoever. Documentation was very very poor for the player itself. They  didn't come right out and tell you that you can press IN on the scroll  button to select accessory menu command such as backlight.

The first one is that I found no explicit instructions for its use. It only  has three controls: a bookmark button, a browse button and a multi control  which also has a button function. These controls are sketchily described in  a folder but all the ins and outs are not listed in any source that I could  find. The second problem was that the first CD that I tried to process  through Rioport Soundjam MP caused the program to crash after two tracks.  Attempting to restart caused the program to destroy my system folder,  requiring a total restore of my hard drive. Downloading to the unit is a  simple drag-and-drop of either a single selection or a series of them. The  32MB cards ar easy to load and are more cost-effective at this time than  are the 64MB cards. Once the 64MB cards come down in price this will be an  unbeatable unit."

I love this thing, its so small and lightweight! the headphones arent the best, so i just use my other ones. The 64 mb's is a good thing, i can fit about 18 songs on it, which is about 1 1/2 hours. the software for mac, sound jam  mp, is verrrryyy easy to use. I do have 2 complaints about it though. If  you listen to it alot, you will be changing batteries about every 2 days.  they dont last so either get lithium batteries or rechargable batteries.  also, you cant pick your order of the songs once theyre on there. if you  want a song in a different place, you have to go and delete everything and  put it in the new order. same thing for changing names of songs. but its  still worth 5 stars cuz changing things around only takes 2  minutes. its a  really good product. if your looking into it, get the rio 500 , 64mb built  it but you can also get a flash card for 32. its great, very easy to use,  tiny, light...etc."

I am very happy with it, and am glad that i didn't buy the 300 model.  The 64 bit memory is great, the design is small and compact, it sound GREAT, and it is so easy to use.  There are a few disadvantages to this MP3 player, but they aren't big.  There is no AC adaptor, so you are always running off batteries, but it  lasts a long time, and if you really want to, got some rechargable  batteries.  The head phones do suck, but oh well.  They are a good brand  (Koss) but they are uncomfterable and the ear buds are too big for most  people.  Those are the only disadvantages that I have come across.  The  music is great, and it takes 5-7 seconds to download from your computer to  the player.  It comes with softwear, carrying case, headphones, the UBS  cable, detailed instructions (you won't need them, the softwear is very  easy to use) and one hell of an MP3 player.  I am however looking into a  memory upgrade to store more music.  I can fit about 12 songs on the memory  I have now.  I would recomend this product to amyone who wants to listen to  great music on the go."

It was enough to get me interested in a website called Audible.com (now a direct link from Amazon.com under the talking books section). To make a long story short, when the Rio 500 came out earlier in the year I simply had to own one. It holds up to 26 hours of audio for audio books. That means you can get up to 4 whole books in the unit at once! Unabridged books, if they are short. If you are a ""books on tape"" person, you should look at the Rio's Audible Manager software that comes with it and you should check out Audible.com's 14,000 titles (again, a direct link from Amazon.com's talking books). When I commute, I don't have to fumble with tapes and I can listen to my books. I can also have them on airplanes and in hotel rooms. About the size of a single cassette, this little jewel is sized for portability and travel needs. Don't overlook this potential benefit when shopping for MP3 players."

Also, you will only ever get  about 10 hours play out of the batteries rather than the quoted 13. Still,  this is still better than most other products. In short, as long as you  stick with the original software and wait for better cards, the Rio 500 is  undoubtedly the best product available at the moment."

It only comes with one page of very baisic instructions.  There were some very important functions that I  didn't even know about for about a month after I bought it, until I finally  found someone else on the net who was able to help me.  If you have a  Macintosh computer, then I would recomend this player to you over the other  players available for Mac OS because of the functions and the ease of use  after you get past the instruction problem, but I would not recomend buying  this if you don't know anybody else who owns one who can help you learn how  to use it.  Overall, I have to rate this player at 3 stars, but if it  wasn't for the instruction problem, I would probably rate the player at  about 4 1/2 stars."

I have used RealJukebox from the beginning, which has eliminated the issues with Audible. I have also found the headphones (a common source of complaint) to be fine. Sound quality is not true audiophile standard, but when you're running or biking, that is of little importance. It sounds fine in 99% of the situations in which you would likely be using it.  I agree, however, that there seems to be a slight quality control problem. When my arrived, the play, stop and pause buttons all did the same thing (paused the music). I didn't think it was a sufficient problem to return it, but it has been a minor annoyance. The volume is also not particularly loud when you're outside.  Other than some minor quibbles, I would recommend it pretty strongly."

It is still small enough to fit in your shirt  pocket and not bulge, and the 4 hours of  battery life is more than  adequate (if you plug into these for more than four hours at a time, you  have way too much spare time).  The sound is excellent, but unless you use  the optical cable (which, contrary to what some people say, IS supplied  with the unit) to get the digital sound from your source, be prepared for a  recording not too much better than a regular tape.

Comprised of intertwining mysteries that depict Holmes' and Watson's investigations into the seamy side of Victorian London, the novel is a great Sherlockian adventure.  Homes and Watson are absolutely true to character and Horowitz so skillfully echoes Doyle's writing style, that one could easily believe it was written by Doyle himself."

Many of the actions depicted were not true to his character as depicted in the Conan Doyle stories. The biggest example of this(spoiler alert)is the fact that Sherlock Holmes never would have been set up as he was in this book. He was a genius and master of disguise. He simply wasn't obtuse enough to walk into such an obvious trap. Instead of capturing the real feel of the characters, the author depends too much on throwing in various references to the Doyle stories trying to make it seem more authentic."

Anthony Horowitz has done an amazing job of telling a brand new Holmes and Watson story while staying with the flavor and style of the original Conan-Doyle stories. Holmes and Watson are at their best in this story of murder and revenge - and something equally as vile and sinister. The familiar characters are still there: Holmes and Watson, inspector Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, brother Mycroft Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars.  Whether you are a Sherlock Holmes fan or not this book is packed with mystery and adventure."

I probably wouldn't have finished it if it hadn't been but I knew it was thoughtfully picked and felt guilty. I'm glad I did persist however as the story, though no-one could possibly think it was remotely Doyle-like, was interesting enough. There were many inconsistencies such as the servant Patrick (a storyline I thought needed tying up at the end seeing as he was suspected at various stages)who in Watson's second visit to the Carstairs claimed to be from Belfast but when Holmes arrives in the final visit he is suddenly from Dublin. Those are capital cities of 2 different countries."

This is a very good quality radio and I think that it has everything to do with where it is placed in the kitchen, as other people have stated.  I live in a rural area with mountains all around us too.

I highly recomend this product to anyone...After using the Rio for a long enough time I think that you will also feel as I do. The need for disks! you want to be able to take like 20 songs on a disk and just keep em in your pocket. Although the rio hold alot, you will find that you may want another song that you have, but not on there. With minidisks it is solved, just pop in the other disk... It is really up to your preference, getting up in the morning and loading the songs you want for the day on your Rio or just poping the disks in to a MiniDisk when you want.

I suggest buying  rechargeable batteries and a charger so you don't go broke buying  batteries, and if you do use regular batteries make sure they're something  like Duracell Ultra or another battery for high tech equipment.  Other than  those few downsides the Rio 500 is great, the sound quality is great its  very portable and has some great features."

The MZ-R55 may currently be the  smallest unit in the US, but that's really all it is; what you do have is  no battery life (4hrs) and a lack of features (more on that later).  The  Sony MZ0-R50 may have been large but at least it ran for more than twice  the time of the R55, and the Aiwa AM-F70, may be slightly larger than the  R55, but fully loaded it works for a whopping 30hrs. Now for the (lack of)  features...no jog dial (very useful for titiling), no progammable play, and  no backlighting on the unit itself. I'm sorry to bash this unit so badly,  but those are the facts.

If you want to record a MD at CD quality, you need a CD player with an optical output, which is not common, an optical cable (sold separately) and you must be willing to sit for the entire duration of the CD without so much as bumping the recorder.  On the R-55, the unit is quite heavy, especially if the AA battery pack is attached, which is constantly because the rechargeable is weaker than my grandma on morphine."

I have tried to wear  or hold it every way possible when running and haven't found a solution  yet.

I like it because I can hook it up to my home stereo,and also play it in my car (with cassett adapter) and its got great sound.  The part about the batteries is so true.., that is one drawback.  I've recorded over 80 disc, and just about all of them have excellent quality.  I've never listened to another MD so I don't know if there is a difference in quality of sound.  Also you do have to crank up the volume to get good sound if your using it as a walkman.  It wont blow you away...but it's alright as a walkman."

It was only on Monday that I started to read it and I couldn't stop until I finished it on Wednesday. I feel Holmes was portrayed rather well but I'm only a 13 year old with limited knowledge on all Holmes. He creates a gripping and yet mysterious plot that takes twists and turns every other page.

It is of high quality and may not be totally modern but it does play music and that's why you buy discmans right? Anyway, there are a couple things that could be improved. First, it doesn't have antiskip so everytime you even tap it, it will stop and then start up again 10 seconds later. Don't worry, it doesn't damage your CDs or at least it hasn't damaged any of mine. Second, it doesn't have a pause button which really stinks. Third, the headphone that come with it are really bad. The foam is peeling off and the sound is not very strong. Also, after you've had it a while you'll notice that you have to move the little headphone plug around to get the sound to come in with out crackling or only coming out in one ear."

I still make mixed tapes and love to hear them on the go, I keep this one in my car for work breaks or walking in the park. This model really is a solid beat-around walkman that has decent quality sound. A good feature about this model is the safety latch that holds the tape in, in case you want to run like it is 1989. Seriously though most walkmans the tape will fall out if you are moving around too much but this one is tough."

There's a little too much action (to meet current ""needs"" in mysteries and thrillers), and something else is not quite right.  Can't put my finger on it.  But Horowitz does an excellent job of imitating the writing style of Conan Doyle, and the personalities of Holmes and Watson shine through.  And the story itself, even apart from Sherlock Holmes, is very good--even important and relevant.  The aging Watson's longing for Holmes friendship is quite poignant.  I think most Sherlock Holmes fans will like it."

If you aren't very familiar with Sherlock Holmes, I could bump this up to a 4, maybe a 5, because it is not a bad book, but since it is being hyped as practically the second coming of Arthur Conan Doyle due to official seal of approval by the Arthur Conan Doyle Estate (it's literally on the cover!), I can't. It's being marketed to those familiar with Holmes and to that effect, there are certain details that pull you out of the story and make you realize you aren't reading Doyle."

Sherlock Holmes is back again with Watson's narrative and Horowitz's tale. This book remains as one of the best Sherlock Holmes novels after 'The Hound of Baskervilles' 'The Valley of Fear' 'The Sign of Four' 'A Study in Scarlet'. This is not only for hardcore Holmes fans but also for people who started reading detective stories. As we all know Anthony Horowitz spun a good tale and made the narrative very interesting. There are some boring parts in the story. Ignore them and you will have the real fun which takes you to a ride back to the 'Victorian Times'."

A Rio 500, and two Discmans, one of which is this model.  When I want to listen to my own radio stations this is the machine to do it.  If you get it don't try to get any stations that aren't  very clear on your car's radio.  Yet of my 20 presets around 10 come in  good.  This is also because I have some stations that are from other places  that don't come in well on any radio.  This Discman has a great Cd-player  too and can play burned CDs.  Mine seems to play CD-Rs only not CD-RWs.  Maybe it'll be different with diferent brand of CDs.  The headphones are  great depending on what kind you like.  I generally use my Rio 500  headphones in it because it has a better quality and can play louder.  The  remote on the system is great.  After about 1 or 2 uses you'll know what  all the buttons do.  There is also a lock feature on the remote and player  itself which allows the buttons to be turned off.  The volume still works.  The lock can be taken off by flipping the switch.  The bass is great.  There are two levels: Groove and Megabass.  Groove is for all volumes.  Megabass is for low-medium volumes or else the sound will be distorted.  I  also like the rechargeable batteries which can be charged by plugging th  included AC adapter in and putting the batteries into the player.  There  are also play modes.  If you are looking for a CD player with a couple of  other features this is it."

Everything from your refridgerator to your bed will be somehow connected to the internet. CD's are already on their way out but now what? Well, since the world will be digital and not even need 'portable minidisks' than why go back to disks at all? If we can listen to music without replacing anything than why should we. What I'm saying is, the Rio is most likely one of the best and easiest MP3's to have. Minidisks are just going back to disks when we should be done with them already. Forget MiniDisks, they were old before they started. Get this MP3 player, it is great."

Now I would only say that it was an incredibly dumb marketing more to bundle a quite decent mp3 player with beyond tacky headphones!  4 stars to the player, 3 stars to the software that wants to ""get all over your drive and make things complicated"" instead of just letting you transfer files directly over, and a ""0"" star (as in complete fizzle) on the headphones."

And the nice thing about RealJukebox is that you can save your  MP3's in playlists and then upload and download playlists to your RIO in a  matter of seconds. Once I got it working I am quite pleased with the size  and ease of use. One other thing.. I bought this unit BECAUSE of it's size.  I hate working out with a bulky cassete player hanging off my shorts.

No Jack The Ripper or Dracula mash-ups or revisionist stunts, just a straight ahead superbly written Holmes story with a well crafted mystery and a shocking conclusion that entirely justifies why this is a story Watson could not tell at the time.

Well anyways, it took two  days but it was worth it. I give the Rio500 4 stars because the technical  staff at Rio was very helpful and now that it is working it is excellent.

The program also burns cd's in case you need that too. The memory on the Rio is 64mb, which isn't too bad unless you listen to a lot of house music remixes like I do that are 9-12minutes each and wind up being 9MB-15MB a piece.

It reproduces the original illustrations by Sidney Paget, which is a big plus. It really gives you a sense of how Holmes and Watson and the fictive 221B Baker Street apartment were imagined by his contemporaries. What can I say? The Adventures contain some of the best-known classics - The Speckled Band (a forerunner of the sub-genre of locked room mysteries), The Five Orange Pips (one of the personal favorites of the author), ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (a battle of wits between Holmes and Irene Adler), and other famous ""adventure"" stories. You may have seen the plots before, because other writers copied and imitated Doyle. But the writing is as contemporary and fast-paced as ever. It's a testimony to the prowess of Doyle as a writer that the Adventures remains an exciting good read after more than a century since the stories were first serialized in a magazine."

I've spected something much better from an such remarkable company as Sony,  I remembered the times when they did stuff at Japan, and USA, now even the  cd-r media and the batteries are made in Indonesia, if Sony continues  manufacturing their electronic devices in those countries they will loose  costumers"

The only clue being that mysteriously all songs on  transfer list are now checked.

Only  problem: once in a while the MP3 bitrate converter program (downgrades  >128 kbs MP3s to save space) causes glitches in the MP3s (those little  squeaks and blips you hear once in a while in MP3s).

Depending on how big the songs are, you store from 9 to 15 [or that's  what i can get]. Also i've dropped it way too many times but, it's fine. It  just won't break. Lastly, it looks cool too.

One of these features that it lacks is that Rio has a lot of memory for a MP3 player these days,  and it can only play 2 HOURS of songs with its onboard memory. After that,  its $100 for a 1 hour (32mb) flash card. With CD's and MD's, the hour is  for about $3. Also, there are not many different models to choose from,  whoch is a drawback. There is also the problem of BATTERIES. Now, I have a  suckie CD player, so I only get 6 hours every 2 batteries, but some CD  players can accomnplish 50+ hours of CD playing on 2 batteries. 12 hrs/1  battery is pretty much outragous (thats why I need a new CD player). Wait a  couple years for better MP3 players. Untill then, I recommend a MiniDisc  System or A CD System. Much Better Value."

I highly reccomend that you duct tape the rio to a good old  sony walkman, and groove out that way.  This also allows you to look more  down to earth, rather than have people get MP3envy over your compact  MP3equipment.  (Don't try sticking the rio inside of your walkman and  closing the walkman's door- it will break the tape spindles of your  walkman)."

The plot was transparent and easily guessed only a short way into the novel.  The references to the actual Holmes stories seem perfunctory and add little to the narrative.  And the period detail is questionable.  The Carstairs household staff, whose composition is oddly emphasized, lacks the essential one or more housemaids.  Holmes and Watson are constantly jumping into ""fourwheelers,"" when in fact the two-wheeled Hansom Cab was the primary form of urban transport for one or two people; it appears frequently in the original stories.  The four-wheeled Hackney coach was only used for a larger number of passengers.  What a shame that Horowitz, whose evocatuion of a period was so brilliant in the ""Foyle's War"" series didn't devote more time to research for this one.  The best thing about the book is the deliciously silky texture of the dust jacket."

The character of Dr. John Watson is also un-Conan Doyle-like, as he puts himself forward too much. It is a good device for a near 400 page novel, too long for a real Sherlock story, but it just doesn't work. You see a glimpse of Holmes but never feel a reality. Better you should spend your time searching out the three L. B. Greenwood Holmes novels and reading them. They are much more satisfactory."

When it arrived, it was an easy and straight forward install. Plug the supplied cable into the hub, plug the hub into the computer's USB port, plug the devices into the hub, you're done.  Turning the computer's power on, five LEDs lit up green.  One LED for each port and one showing the hub is running from the computer's power supply. A red LED lights to show when the HUB's wall wart is supplying the power.  Elegant simplicity in a translucent package, the most difficult thing to expect in setting this up is opening the blister pack to get at it."

The reason I bought a hub was to, well, hub things. I had enough USB devices to merit it, and after installation, I thought my troubles were over. No more plugging and unplugging. My bad. Each of the 4 ports had it's own personality. One didn't like the tablet, but loved the SmartMedia reader. It was ambivalent towards the scanner. Another happily took the visor but shunned the scanner.Getting each peripheral to work together at the same time was impossible. In some cases, powering up a device would shut the hub down entirely, necessitating unplugging it. Granted, some USB devices don't like to share, like the Nomad Docking station and the printer, but it makes me wonder about how a person could possible link 127 devices at the same time.

If you need a better quality copy, have your sender send you a 'Word' document over the internet, and just print it out.  Wonderful for sending faxes.

I have seen some people saying that 2MB was not enough memory. BULL****. I have 88 applications on it and still have 900k free, which is a little under half left!.. I am an avid stock  trader and use it to make my trades at work. Mytrack and Fidelity both  allow you to trade via the palm if you have an account. I have one with  Mytrack and recommend them. I also use it for weather, travel directions,  email, news, movie times, white pages lookup, shopping comparison, checking  flight schedules, UPS and FEDEX package tracking.. This device is SWEET! I  had never had any interest in a palm device until I heard about the VII  with wireless connection. I have had mine for a week now and can't put it  down.. Very handy.. The internet connectivity through palm.net is a bit  pricey but I am sure it will come down with time.. Unlimited access is  44.00 month.. They do have other plans available by the amount of data  transmitted. Lifting the antenna gets you connected to the net in about 3  seconds.. The web clipping is fine, stock quotes, directions, phone number  lookups, email, etc.. Granted this is not an Internet browser but a great  second best, the email rocks, when you sign up with palm.net you get a free  email account that you can check and send email from the palm.. Very cool..  I guess I only have one minor complaint, there is a bit of a glare  sometimes when held at a certain angle.. Like I said a minor issue.. I  bought it for the internet access but the built in address book and planner  are nice too.. It is a little pricey at 450.00 but I do recommend it to  anyone that has an interest in it but needs that confirmation from someone  that has it already.. One last note, there are hundreds of applications for  it that can be found on the Internet.. Some are shareware and some are  freeware, Alot of the good one's are free.. Out of the 88 I have, there is  only one that I have to pay for, a stock portfolio manager.. ENJOY!"

I didn’t read anywhere that this was a time delayed unit. Or that the perpetrator had to do jumping jacks to get it to come on; but that is what appears to be happening. I don’t know where it detects a warm body on a not so cold winter night; say around 40F degrees. Due to my health I may or may not be sending it back. But this is not your father’s Oldsmobile. I totally suggest that you seek another brand. Ron /// Update: Mon, Dec 24, 2018: I am returning this unit. Believe what the other reviews say that you can’t get much more than a 30ft detection range. I have worked with motion sensors for over 30 years. I have tried everything I could think of to get this to work right, but it doesn’t go much past 30ft. And it acts like it has a built in time delay. I have an old unit, I would guess about 30 years old on my front porch that almost snaps on when the detection field is crossed."

The old IR sensor unit had 240-degree coverage and no matter how it was positioned or how low the sensitivity was adjusted, it would always turn the floodlights on whenever a car drove down the road past the house, which is well over 75-feet away through trees and brush. So, I decided to try this model with its narrower 180–degree coverage and thankfully the problem has been solved. I think having it go on and off so often probably shortened its life, so I'm hoping this new sensor will last longer since the false triggering from vehicles on the street is no longer a problem. I find the 5-minute timer position to be perfect for that side of the house. So, far I'm happy with this sensor and if it continues to hold up, I will likely buy two more spares for the other sets of flood lights we have on the house."

I have only had one problem with this HUB and that is when I am using the other 3 ports and plug in my USB video camera I run into a bandwidth problem and windows screams at me about it. Cameras can be rather intense of a sytem bus and like CD-Burners are best left on a direct system port rather than running off a HUB so im not suprized this happened. Another perk is this HUB lights up like an X-mas tree with 6 LED's and a clear case to really let it glow. Not that this is a real big deal but I like it ;) Overall a very good buy and well worth the $$$

Such character is at odds with what was depicted in the story of Greek Interpretator and the Adventure of Bruce-Partington Plan. It seemed that he cared about his friend more than his brother, and out of my surprise, he did not try his best to protect his beloved country any more. Moreover, what Sherlock explained how he knew the House of Silk is very weak. Very few clues were laid down in the framework of story.

7801,1409133826,RIML6SZQ7QP6P,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2019",8 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"It seems churlish to criticise this book.  The author is so proudly and disarmingly pleased with his handiwork, and insists on taking us into his confidence (in a note at the end) as to how he accomplished it, that I hesitate to point out that it contains several inexplicable deficiencies.  The story as a whole is a real cracker – a genuine mystery, and the reader is always agog to find out what’s going to happen next.  The pace is too hectic, however, as we’re whisked from one mysterious highlight to another with scarcely a pause for breath.  Dr Watson, on the other hand, is rather too garrulous, and pontificates and reminisces at the drop of a hat – largely to help fill up space, it appears, to gratify the publishers.  But the timing is all wrong.  We are told that the action is taking place in 1890 and that Holmes and his exploits are, by that time, famous throughout the land.  But in actual fact, the short stories did not start appearing until July 1891.  They were published, we learn, in the Cornhill Magazine, whereas in reality they were the making of The Strand Magazine.  And Watson is apparently writing in 1915, long after the death of Holmes, whereas we know that Holmes was still active in August 1914 and scarcely in his dotage at that time.  It might be best to think of Holmes and Watson, as conceived by Horowitz, as occupying some kind of parallel universe to the one conceived by Conan Doyle.  One small point that niggles is that the strange behaviour of the Irish scullery boy in the house at Wimbledon is truly never explained.  It’s enjoyable, in short, but not quite the genuine article."

A thoroughly good read, dont just take my word for it as it has been officially been endorsed by the Conan Doyle family (the only author to have done so).

So I installed 2 flood lights, put in 2 LED flood lightbulbs, and installed the motion sensor between them. It was easy to install and wire up to the house electricity. This has a photo eye which is supposed to keep the lights off during the day and on at night when the motion sensor gets tripped. Now sometimes I have seen them on during the day with no movement around the area, why that is I'm not sure as of right now. It works well and does what I want it to do."

If you currently use a hub and you upgrade to a switch like this one, you won't be disappointed."

The bottomline about ""I Am Legend"" is simple:  it's about loneliness and loss in a post-apocalypse world overrun by vampires.  If that doesn't cause you to dissolve with laughter, then ""I Am Legend"" might be for you.  It's well-written, holds the reader's interest, and has been the basis for three movies.  It will appeal to most teenage boys (or to grown up men who remember how the world feels to teenage boys).  However, it doesn't deserve five stars because it doesn't have enough cool details about the end of humanity."

I'm not someone who gets all excited about the latest electronic gadget - the only thing I care about is whether it is truly useful in organizing my life.  The Palm Vx has definitely passed that test.  I found it incredibly easy to install and get started with, and I was quickly addicted to being able to download Outlook with the punch of a button.  Among other things, my Palm has made my cell phone a more useful tool because I now always have hundreds of phone numbers with me at all times.  One of the advantages of the Palm Vx over other handhelds is that it is so light and easy to carry.  I know lots of people who got Handsprings lured by the promose of all the fancy attachments.  To a man they regret it - they don't use the attachments and it's significantly more difficult to carry.  Still, the Palm Vx wouldn't be worth it if it was just a very expensive address book.  I suggest buying ""Palm Pilot:  The Ultimate Guide"" to find out how to really get the most out of your Palm V.  It's an essential supplement to the basic information that comes with the Palm, and it comes with a handy CD with great programs. I've used my Palm Vx for about 8 months and find it more useful all the time.  However, I recently put the Palm Vx through the ultimate challenge:  I gave my 61 year-old and technicially challenged Dad one for Christmas.  Within in hours he was hooked up and writing graffitti like a pro. He's had it for a couple of months, and like me he swears by it."

I switched to the Palm Vx because my Palm III gave out after months of abuse riding in my back pocket.  The Vx is solidly built, very reliable and never needs batteries.  I use mine heavily and sometimes forget to recharge it in the cradle.  I've found that the battery lasts about three weeks with heavy use as long as you don't use the backlight.  I now use my Palm Vx with my laptop running Windows 2000 and synchronize my data using the infrared port.  The cradle is just a charge stand for me!  If you're nervous about buying this product... relax!  I teach computer skills to executives in the Chicago area.  The learning curve for Palm devices is about 20 minutes.  There is a shorthand called ""graffiti"" that you will need to learn to write in your information, but you can also use your computer or a separately available keyboard to enter in your data.  Newer and more powerful palm devices have been introduced since I bought mine, but the Vx is an excellent value now that the price has dropped.  And it's still the smallest!  If you're looking for a PDA to handle your personal and business information and do not need to display color photos, videos or play MP3s, the Palm Vx is perfect."

It was bothering me--perhaps it wouldn't someone else--so I took it to my local Radio Shack and bought the following adapter, which has corrected the problem...I now hear out of both sides of my headset.  The adapter cost approx. $4.00, and is called a ""Gold-Plated Stereo-to-Mono Audio Adapter; Accepts 1/8"" stereo plug; Fits 1/8"" mono jack, part number:  274-882.""

The story interweaves 2 investigations, crosses the Atlantic, sees Sherlock arrested for murder and shows the worst side of Victorian England. There aren't too many of the traditional ratiocinations (for which I deducted a star) but the plot is clever and satisfying and shows Lestrade in a better light.

The characterisation was pretty good, as was the story. Sure, some bits defy reason. Why did H and W have to blag their way in to the house? Why did the mysterious stranger abduct Watson rather than just send another clue? But this sort of problem is endemic in the genre and probably present just as much in Conan Doyle. I guessed quite a few bits of what was going on (not the prison breakout, that was rather a classic) but most of my book group didn't. I did find it a bit overlong, with slightly too many strands of plot, and I didn't really like the affectation of Watson writing it in his dotage - didn't really add anything for me, and distances you from the action."

In my view Anthony Horowitz has superbly captured the essence of Sherlock Holmes. All the Holmesian traits are there, including the falibility, but primarily the sense of justice and the refusal to accept a man's right to be believed simply because of who he is. This is an excellent addition to the post-Conan Doyle canon and I shall definitely be reading its successor.

If you quickly flick the light switch off then on the motion sensor portion is not used and the light stays on.

If light can get to the photocell it may turn on in the dark then the resulting light tells the box to turn off.

I would really give this 4.5 stars as there are a couple of questionable issues e.g. apart from finding a way to include a character, why go to all that trouble to give someone a key when the person giving it would clearly know it would be of little use. However, it is a very well written murder mystery and just great to have Holmes and Watson on the case. At the end Anthony explains his approach to writing the story which is also very interesting.

The opening reminded me very much of my response to the raising of the curtain of an Agatha Christie theatre production.  One knows immediately if it is going to be authentic. So with this reproduction from the first page it was convincing as an ""original"".  I think had it not been I couldn't have continued and would have binned it.  Yes there were differences, the main one being the crime to be solved.  It was too modern in theme. The other has been touched on by other reviewers: the Holmes-Watson relationship.  More difficult to assess as at times I could have been reading an original such was the symbiotic gel between them, at others I felt Horowitz missed it, but only just.  Yet that was enough to cause me to say ""no"" out loud. At other times I could have forgotten completely that this was not the trusty pen of our own Dr Watson. Background research was brilliantly executed as we were transported around the streets of London, feeling the exclusive power of Gentlemen's clubs, society drawing rooms and the stench and poverty of the slums. The energy of Holmes and his speech and manner were captured wonderfully, as were the asides to himself of Watson's references to Holmes's ""habit"" and his morocco pouch. Is there to be another one from this pen?"

However, whilst I can quite believe that there were ragged ill-fed and desperate kids all over the city I cannot believe they would be running around barefooted on cobble streets in December (this was referenced on more than one occasion) Even the very poorest would have had some means of foot cover, if only rags wrapped around their feet, because otherwise they would almost immediately suffer frostbite and inevitably death. sorry to be a pedant."
8010,1409133826,R172KGX1CYO062,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 3, 2017",,Verified Purchase,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is full of amazing descriptions of the poorer side of London life and I felt like I had been transported back in time. I know that some may feel that this book is not a traditional Sherlock Holmes tale, but I thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the criminal underworld of Victorian London. I will admit that I haven't read many of the original tales, but after reading this one I am definitely going to read some, especially as reviewers have stated that book stays true to the original style."
8011,1409133826,R3TJF3WM4O1ESO,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 27, 2016",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"A modernised take on Sherlock Holmes. There's something that doesn't quite hit the spot in the way that Conan Doyle does, but it's a good enough read anyway. The plot is a modern topical story that is already done to death in other places, so that's a bit disappointing. We are transported back to what we imagine London was like at the turn of the 20th century, although the fact that the minimum drinking age at that time was 14 seems to have eluded the author, and there are one or two historical inaccuracies in the language."
8012,1409133826,R2TJ46CRURAZDV,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 3, 2012",,Verified Purchase,"This is a well executed homage to Conan Doyle which, in my opinion anyway, makes a very good stab at capturing Watson's narrative voice. One could clearly quibble with how well it fits in with the canon at a detailed level. For example, Watson did not take part in the investigation into the Giant Rat of Sumatra, a case which predated his meeting Holmes, and more importantly a significant part of the action here doesn't make any sense when viewed against the background of 'The Man With The Twisted Lip'. However, as Horowitz himself points out in his note on the writing of the novel, Conan Doyle was himself inconsistent about details such as the bodily location of Watson's war wound so I think that we can let that pass."
8013,1409133826,RBF6YUFM47A0M,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 29, 2017",,Verified Purchase,"It wasn't all that long ago that I read all the original Sherlock Holmes stories and so I was a little wary of this one. I know many people have tried to emulate Doyle in the past with varying degrees of success. What I can say is that this story is great. The spirit of Holmes and Watson, and indeed, Victorian London, is brilliantly captured, and if the conclusion of the story eventually shows merely how little has changed in the last over a 100 years, it's a sobering appreciation that corruption simply never goes away. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series"

Previously I used a planner and a sharp wizard. I wasn't sure just how much I would use the Palm, but it is now a part of my being! The IIIXE screen is larger than the Palm screen on the M105, the memory is the same, and I don't find the squared shape at all uncomfortable. I highly recommend a Palm to women ...it's easy to learn graffiti, and it leaves a heck of a lot of room in your purse (no more planner, or little scraps of notes). I use it constantly, from ""Handy Shopper"" to jog my memory for groceries and even sequence them by aisle (shopping in 1/4 the time because of fewer returns to the same section) -- to Avantgo internet surfing, freeing up the home internet for my son. I read books, I play games, I track all of my work stuff, and I keep better track of all my finances (actually recording all my debit card expenditures!). Balancing my checkbook is a snap. It can be an adult ""gameboy"" and a geek organizer as well as a library and reference tool. The software available is amazing and I find new uses almost daily."

With 8 mb of memory, and software to link to Microsoft Outlook, this is definitely the business person's machine.  I looked at the Palm IIIc, but wasn't impressed with the display, and for nearly twice the price, didn't feel it was worth it to get color.  I started out wanting the Palm V - but then realized its limitations - only 2 mb memory, no flash rom (so you can never upgrade the operating system), and it isn't even loaded with the most current palm OS operating system (the Palm V has OS version 3.1, vs the Palm IIIxe which has version 3.5).  The major benefits of the newer version are some new features and faster hotsinking.  I've been a Palm user for over 2 years and am so pleased with these machines that I wouldn't consider a Visor or anything else!  The one drawbrack (and the reason for 4 stars and not 5), is that Palm still has some work to do on their displays - need a higher resolution, easier to read display."

Both essentially have the same specs, but the Vx has the obvious ""cool"" factor. I decided on the IIIxe for a number of reasons. Firstly, the IIIxe was value  for money. The Vx cost... more but does exactly the same things.  Secondly, there are more (and better) after-market cases for the IIIxe. Vx  owners invariably complain of the lack of good cases for their Palm.  Thirdly, there have also been a good number of complaints regarding the  location of the Vx's on/off switch. Personally, I find this rather critical  since I put the Palm in my pocket most of the time. There are other  reasons, including the flip cover which the Vx does not have. The Vx is  also not expandable. This is, of course, assuming that Palm will develop an  expansion kit for the Palm in the near future. One also has to send in the  Vx back to Palm when its internal rechargeable battery is no longer  working. However, I did encounter a couple of problems with the IIIxe. Less  than a week after receiving my unit, two buttons used to launch the main  applications were broken. The alarm on the IIIxe is also rather feeble,  making it hard to hear when you are outdoors."

Just as powerful and useful as Palm's higher priced V and Vx models, at about $100 cheaper. Plus, its got an edge over the models its been replaced by. The m100 and m105 do not contain Flash memory like this unit does. That means the users of those machines are stuck with whatever OS comes on the PDA. The IIIxe has 2 MB of Flash memory, so its readily upgradable. The only mistake Palm made with this model was to discontinue it. If your in the market for a PDA and you can find a IIIxe, I whole heartedly recommend it."

The old power cord worked perfect with this version of the switch and everything clipped in and started working immediately. I also like that it's black rather than the blue of the previous generations.

It's been working great for about 4 years now, but we've now run out of ports.  I did some research on the 8 port router/switch product from Linksys, but the reviews were mixed.  The reviews were mixed for similar competing products also.  So I took the route of getting the EZXS55W to expand our existing home network.  I just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box.  No configuration needed.  It's also very tiny.  I highly recommend the product."

I needed more network ports than my existing Linksys WRT54G wireless router had.  I simply took this switch out of the box, plugged it in, hooked one end of a network cable in to the router and the other in to the uplink port of the switch and I was off an running.  I really like the size which is about half is big as my router.  The status indicator lights on the front are great too; some other brands put these lights on the back.  What's not to like?"

8170,1409133826,R2AOTJHYR098UK,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 28, 2015",,Verified Purchase,"In the reviews there are some frankly nonesense thing said about this book, all about not being up to Conan Doyle's standard and pointing our historical inaccuracies around when Bridge was introduced to the UK."
8171,1409133826,R1VA6LXX7R88YG,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 11, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"I approached The House of Silk with a little trepidation having been a fan of the original stories. However, it seems that the Conan Doyle estate was right to entrust Horowitz with continuing the Holmes canon."
8172,1409133826,R1REZKMQ46UURR,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 1, 2019",,Verified Purchase,Horowitz gets his pastiche just right in this seemingly classic Holmes story.  He keeps the atmosphere of Victorian London while maintaining the interest of modern day readers by calling upon issues that trouble the city still. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend to those readers that enjoy classic whodunit stories such as Poirot and the original Doyle catalogue.
8173,1409133826,R1LR6NC9RCRAZ7,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 28, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday after reading the reviews.  We played it in the car, however I was a bit shocked to discover it was a paedophil ring. This appears to have gone over my son's head though.  It held his attention and has some lovely language which he wouldn't normally meet while playing video games!!!!!"
8174,1409133826,R3R6CVH74TIF7K,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 14, 2012",,Verified Purchase,"I first thought it was a bit weird that an author can create a sequal to a classic when I read P D James Death comes to Pemberley, a follow on story from Austen's Pride and Prejudice. But it was absolutely brilliant. I had never read Austen's book before but it wasn't a disadvantage, as Ms James's story telling was adequate."
8175,1409133826,R31GDNFCYE8BTW,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 24, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"I think it helped that I read this book without having previously read any of the other non-canon unauthorised Holmes fiction so I didn't have any preconceived ideas of how authentic it may or may not read. Having read through some of the reviews, I think some die-hard fans may have slightly unrealistic expectations and were expecting some sort of lost manuscript that's just been discovered originally written by Conan Doyle?! I've read all the originals and loved them; I thought this was a very very good imitation of the style, tone and personalities of the characters we love. I don't have any criticism at all in that regard."

8178,1409133826,RUYOZ0TECMFT1,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 8, 2012",,Verified Purchase,"I have read and enjoyed many of the Conan Doyle stories about Holmes, so I wondered whether this book would maintain the standard. It certainly does and I enjoyed it very much. All the hoped for features are present; analysing obscure clues to form lucid patterns of action, convoluted verbal contests with brother Mycroft, evocative scenes of London and even Moriaty makes a useful contribution to the eventual solution."
8179,1409133826,R1Y6VY63NS4CWY,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 4, 2019",,Verified Purchase,"It feels awkward to read about Holmes from other authors. However the book does render the methods of deduction, though the plot is a bit weak. Additionally, Watson is strange, but he is a friend as usual."

The FM tuner sounds great despite what I've read from other reviewers.  As an owner of a sound studio, my standards are high, and the Nomad sounds excellent.  The big test was to see if the management software and data transfer was a breeze or not.  Took about 15 secs to load the software plug in the device and start transferring my mp3s.  the software is the better than rio port (diamond's).  I haven't owned this product long enough to speak for its durability, but the basic design is tight and puts the new RIO 600 to shame, and is a step above my old RIO 500.  The remote control is a very handy tool to keep the main unit deep in your pocket or backpack.  As long as it keeps up what it's doing, it will be on my recommend list for all. enjoy."

8242,B00004RG6K,RWT40QVU7J5ZQ,Excellent for music on the go,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2001",9 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for an MP3 player to bring on long runs (I'm a marathon runner) and trips to the gym.  This was one of the few MP3 players that met a series of criteria I had chosen: lightweight, capable of carrying over an hour of music, a good remote control, and an FM radio.  I've used it for four months and I'm very satisfied.  The remote takes a little time to learn how to use, but works very well.  The remote clips easily on a belt or clothing, and is both sturdy and light weight.  The sound is excellent, and it has performed perfectly on long runs.  The software is relatively easy to use for loading songs.  Here are the limitations: the FM reception is not as good as on my old Sony FM Walkman.  The battery life is fairly short (about 4-5 hours)- I now go running with an extra AA battery as back-up.  The software is not very sophisticated.  For example, you have to move songs to a different position by moving them one position at a time as you can't drag and drop a song to a different position.  You can preset a lot of FM radio stations (32), but setting them is a little tricky- if you push the set button more than a second it switches you to the old preset station rather than setting it on the new station.  This can be painful as switching stations is slow.  Despite these limitations, the final tribute came from my wife.  She scoffed at my purchase as an excess expense in which I got carried away with technology.  Now she steals my Nomad II so often that I may have to get one for her if I hope to use it myself!"

VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND SMALL TO FIT WITH ITS HANDY BELT CLIP. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS UNIT ONLY CAN HOLD 64MB MEMORY (ABOUT LESS THEN AN HOURE OF MUSIC).

THEIR IS NO ROOM FOR YOU OT PULL THE CARD OUT AND THE BATTERY IS IN THE WAY. VERY POOR DESIGN ON THIS MATTER. I ASK MY SELF WHY CREATIVE WOULD DESIGN SUCH A GREAT DEVICE BUT ONLY STORES UP TO 64MB OR MUSIC AND HAVE SUCH A POOR DESING FOR MEMORY STORAGE.

The band tends to hit your ears. Second, taking out  the battery cover requires a lot of effort which, up to this point, I have  not figured yet a reliable way of doing it.  And there is no ac battery  output unless you get a docking station. Thus, except for those few  noticeable glitches this is a great product"

But luckily a co-worker  convinced me to get the Vx, citing all the usual reasons (more memory,  looks cooler, rechargeable battery). After a few days of using it, I  couldn't even fathom going back to the digital diary. Not only is it now a  snap to transfer all my appointments, contacts, and notes into a portable  medium (one press of the Hot Sync button versus entering it all manually on  the digital diary's keyboard), but the Palm can do so much more. I get  news, sports, Rolling Stone, weather reports and movie listings on my Vx  with every Sync. I can play games. I can beam my business card to someone  else (weird the first time you do it, sort of like Star Trek) and receive  one in return. Plus there is a lot of Palm software out there for almost  any purpose. The Vx allows you to have this wealth of capabilities  literally at your fingertips, and the 8MB of memory means you have room for  lots more. And the V series is much more stylish and professional-looking  than the VII and the III series which are also physically larger and thus  less convenient to carry in a pocket. If you have even the slightest need  to be organized, or to have useful information close at hand, then the Palm  Vx is for you."

Then I can relax when  I get home instead of worrying about work due the next day.  The To do list  also replaces my paper agenda and is a very nice feature allowing you to  check off items upon completion.  What can I say?  The Palm IIIxe saves a  ton of time plus it's fun in study hall playing games with others that have  one.  I love the infra red port.  I used to have the IIIe and this is a  much better model allowing me to put in a ton more programs.  An ingenious  device.  I can't think of going back to the old way of using paper anymore.  Palm is definately a must have.  You won't regret purchasing one."

Palm is popular and easy to use, so there are plenty of programs for it.  Grafiti, the custom writing style, is good, but difficult for me due to poor fine-motor skills.  As such, a few letters require several repeats to get.  My wife is much better with the writing portion than I am.  I primarily use this for reminders, phonebook and notes.  Side use is multi-clocks for travelling, and various video games."

Not a problem at all.  Not even a scratch on it! Sturdy design and you feel like you've got something powerful in your hand when you use it.  Looks like something built to MIL specs - which is good.  The only 'flaw' was the graffiti took some getting use since it is an older version of the software - at least I imagine that is the issue.

Concise and succinct he is not. Be ready to speed read and jump passages now and again or you may get bogged down in his meandering verbosity and end up not appreciating his story telling ability."
8315,1409133826,RKEOQ39OJCLZN,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2015",,Verified Purchase,"This takes the Victorian detective into a new and more contemporary area of crime and the author manages it remarkably well. The plot starts with a single theme which, develops into different and seemingly random tangents then carefully and believably brings them to a climactic solution. It's clear the author is a genuine fan of the original stories and at times I was genuinely amazed at how his writing perfectly aligned with the feel of the original stories authentically catching the tone of the elderly Watson. There are thousands of contemporary Holmes stories and many of them are good stories in their own right, but this is the best I've read and the one that for me captures the essence of Conan Doyles plot, style and writing. Can't wait for the next one."

I have never bought books in the past that have been a ""continuation"" of a dead author but I so love Conan Doyle's creation (and Anthony Horowitz's work) that I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did - only one page in and I was once again transported back with Dr. Watson to Baker Street in Victorian London. This is a really good story and most definitely in the voice of Dr. Watson, it was like meeting an old friend again after a gap of many years. No wonder it was a best seller!"
8317,1409133826,R2VSH7HIM3LOPF,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 23, 2017",,Verified Purchase,Terrific yarn in the style of Conan Doyle. I surprised myself by how much I like this. It's well plotted and moves at a cracking pace without ever feeling ersatz. Horowitz has done a stellar job of maintaining the oeuvre and his Holmes and Watson are true to the characters we know and love. Few liberties are taken and there are plenty of little references that die hard Doyle fans will spot. Highly reccomended.

8320,1409133826,R2DEZMLK58CLMX,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 4, 2015",,Verified Purchase,Just like reading a Doyle book. Very entertaining. Great use of the characters and twits in the story were played out like I say above just like a Doyle book. Yes it's quite easy to figure out the script but that's the beauty of Holmes in that it feels like you and him are in on the big picture while Watson isn't. The reason it's not a 5 star is I don't think any Holmes novels are plus a bit of jiggery pokery in chapter 14 which isn't needed. Also the details on London could be better.

It was a very well written book, very descriptive with lots of twists and turns in the plot, all that you would expect to find in a Sherlock Holmes mystery. You could almost feel the cold, damp eeriness of a London pea souper in the late 1800's. I would think this is a good Sherlock Holmes story but just not for me :-) I don't think Holmes fans will be disappointed in this book."

As a Conan Doyle fan I was not disappointed with this book.  Previous experience with Anthony Horowitz is only through children's books, but I found his style just as good to read in a more adult format.  Good story.  Definitely fitted the genre.  And apparently, one of the only (?) Sherlock Holmes books written since his death, to be approved by his estate.  Good for Conan Doyle fans of Holmes as well as for those who have never read any of the original."

In the meantime, I recently bought a Sony Blu-Ray player with Internet video streaming, but I found that the existing Linksys modem/router could not handle the upgraded high-speed service. So I bought a new Motorola DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem. I naively thought I could simply use this Linksys switch to send the signal along its merry way throughout my house. WRONG. After several hours of reseting the IP address on each computer, and several calls to Charter (my ISP), I called Motorola. The Motorola SurfBoard modem is a throughput device, that assigns only one IP and the Linksys switch is not a smart/managed type that can assign individual IP addresses. So I have a new router on its way from Amazon, which should solve the problem, once I place the router immediately after the modem but before the switch! The router will then assign an unique IP address to my four computers and Blu-Ray player. Perhaps this is common knowledge, but the technical support staff at Charter were not aware of this. So just an FYI."

I began my whole Palm expedition several years ago with a Palm Professional (yes, back in the day).  That worked out just fine for the time, but being a gadget junkie, I had to get the Palm V when it came out.  And can I say how much better it was?!?  Not only did you not have to deal with batteries, but you didn't have the bulk that the Palm Pro had.  A few other cool things - the cradle that has a place for your stylus.  This may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it. And I never had any problems with the software. So, as it was I was completely happy with my little, stylish Palm V."

I have become much more independent and productive on my job because of it. It stores way more information that I can put in it. (After 18 months, 500 contacts and loads of internet downloads, memory is only 20 percent full.) It is lightning quick -- pulling information up at a moment's notice. It is easy to operate -- learning to use the Graffiti alphabet system is simple. It is even handy: it fits in a pocket, it allows me to ""beam"" information to other Palm users, there are web services that allow me to down load news, sports, etc., so that I can read my Palm when I'm stuck on the bus, waiting in a line, etc. On the downside: the screen can be hard to read in middle-level light conditions or where there is too much light and reflection is a problem. Also, the screen scratches easily, but that can be solved with a disposable sheet you can attach to the screen. And it has a back-light function, which is really only helpful when you're in complete darkness. I highly recommend it."
8377,B000031KIM,R1FAE7K4UM7EJI,Palm Vx Vs. Nino 312 (WinCE device),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2000",17 people found this helpful,,"The Nino with Case, 20MB CF card and battery weighed 11oz. The Palm Vx was  only 6oz with battery and slim Palm case.  The Palm was also about half as  thick and an inch shorter with the same screen size although an inch in  taken up with the writing area. I first bought the Nino because as a  longtime PC user, I thought that WinCE would be more versatile. I thought  Microsoft would win the battle of the platform, thoughts of Apple thorough  my mind. I didn't want to find that I ran out of memory before it could do  everything that I needed it to do. I found the Nino a palmtop computer  trying to be an organizer and the Palm an organizer trying to be a palmtop  computer. The Nino could do everything and was very expandable. It is a  hand-held computer, but it was just too darn big to carry around in my  pocket. I don't carry a briefcase or travel for business. I wanted an  everyday organizer to hold contacts, itineraries, notes, lists,  appointments, financial information, simple maps and do some calculations.  The Palm Vx does all this in such a small size. If I needed to use a  computer on the road, I'd buy a laptop. I don't need to edit Word  documents, do any database work, access the Internet, use multimedia or  color, read books or play elaborate games on it. I just wanted something to  hold basic information and do relatively simple calculations till I could  transfer it back to my computer. So far it does everything that my Nino  did, but with less memory. I still have 74% memory left. About 2.1 MB out  of 8 for the Palm vs. 15 MB out of 24 for the Nino (with CF card); the  programs use less memory. It my case, size mattered. I found I was never  carrying the Nino when I needed it. I'd leave it in my car. Overall, the  Palm does everything I need and want it to do. I do worry about  expandability, but so far it hasn't been an issue. If I had gone with the  Palm V I'd be in trouble. If you want something that could do those other  things, I'd just spend the money for a laptop. The Nino could do those  other things, but not very well, compared to a laptop. If they could cut  back on the size of WinCE or PocketPC devices I think I'd consider them.  Till then, I'm sticking with Palm."
8378,B000031KIM,R3N7UWW81I8OON,I love mine....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2000",34 people found this helpful,,"When my Palm V was stolen last May, I went right out and bought a Palm Vx to replace it!  Upfront, I should address the comment of the reviewer below who complained of losing his data when the device crashed.  The Palm Vx comes with software that allows you to create a copy of all your Palm data on your computer.  If you lose the Palm data for some reason (or the computer data), you can restore the lost data with a couple of mouse clicks. The Palm comes with a ""cradle"" that is used for recharging and for linking to the computer.  When my Palm was stolen, I easily restored my information into my new Palm Vx.  The process of storing data takes about 15 seconds, and literally just takes a button push after you have put your Palm in the cradle. I should mention that in 18 months of extensive use, I've never ""lost"" my data due to software failure.  I did lose it when my Palm was stolen of course, but was  easily able to replace it. I find two main uses for my Palm--As a scheduler, I can enter something I want to be reminded of at a future date, and have the Palm alert me at a specified time (typically five minutes before the meeting starts, for meetings at my work).  You can easily view all the items in place for each day, and there is also a weekly view.  This can be done years in advance, and doesn't have to be for work stuff--I have a gasket in an underwater camera which needs to be replaced in May, 2002, and I have entered a reminder to alert me at that time! The other thing I use it for is as a way to find ""forgotten"" information.  I make and store memos of important conversation or important information.  Also, I make notes in the ""address book"" of key information about people--Things I've discussed with them, or areas of expertise they have.  I can use the ""find"" feature on my Palm to locate a term.  So if I want to know what conversations I've had about widgets, or who I have talked to that knows about widgets, I can enter ""widget"" in the find feature, and I will be shown a list of all my memos that mention widgets in the text, and anyone in my address book who I listed as being widget-related!  Incidentally, I'll also get a list of any appointments in my calendar that mention widgets. If you are a busy person (and not just a business type, students, or homemakers may benefit as well) I believe you will be able to make good use of a Palm Vx.  You may be equally satisfied with a Handspring, or with other makes of Palm, though.  The two great advantages I see with the Palm Vx (or Palm V, if you can still find one) are that the profile of the device is very slender--It fits in my front slacks pocket without leaving a substantial bulge.  Second advantage is that the internal battery provides power for a week to two weeks of use, and can be recharged by resting in the cradle. No need to buy replacement batteries, or juggle them around replacing them."

After the replacement CD arrived, strange things kept happening, like 3 months of my MS Outlook calendar being purged! After spending several hundred dollars having tech support come in (thinking it was user error) I started again with Palm Tech support. The hardware was bad, and it took more than 15 hours, over a week and a half to get them to admit it and trade for a refurbished unit. There is now a two week backorder on the re-furbished units. I've since polled friends, and it looks like the Palm Vx has some serious problems as everyone who bought one recently has had problems. Buy a IIIx or a Handspring."
8384,B00004RG6K,R2V8VFDHNT09KY,A good player that is now dated,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2006",,,"I first got the Creative NOMAD II in late 2000. At this time, this player was the best you could get back then. The NOMAD II came in two varieties. One model, the DAP-0001, had  no memory built-in and the other model, the DAP-0002, had ether 32 MB or 64 MB of memory built in. I had the former. The NOMAD II had an FM radio, which depending on the area I lived in the radio was good or bad. Voice recording was also in the NOMAD II, but I never really used it. The only format support was MP3 (Microsoft's WMA format came in a later firmware upgrade). Nowadays, when one buys a flash memory based player like the NOMAD II, you can expect the player to have the built-in. The model I had did not. This meant I had to juggle multiple cards, which thinking it over now, defeats the purpose of an MP3 player. The type of card the player used was SmartMedia. While I don't have a problem with this card type, I feel Creative picked the wrong card type. When I was going to upgrade the memory, I found it difficult to find SmartMedia cards greater than 128 MB. I later found out that the player refuses to accept cards with 128 MB of memory without a firmware upgrade. Playlists are basically non-existent on the NOMAD II. The closest thing to a playlist is the order the songs were placed on the NOMAD II. Battery life is pretty good for one that does not have an internal rechargeable battery. However, in saying this I do recommend that a user stick to disposable batteries as I have found rechargeable batteries to unpredictable for this type of gadget. The NOMAD II itself is easy to use once you get used to it. Uploading songs from a Windows computer to the player is not easy and can be tricky for a user unfamiliar with USB and Windows' relationship with it. On a Macintosh, there is no stress needed to find drivers for the NOMAD II or to troubleshoot connection issues; the player interacts with iTunes and allows a user to drag and drop music onto the player and pre-set radio stations in the preferences. On both platforms, the NOMAD II uses USB 1.1, although it should work just as well with the newer USB 2.0."

I also have a Toshiba DVD player (SD-1200) and a Toshiba DVD-Rom drive  on my PC.  Never a problem with any of them."

I have had mine for almost two years and it has performed well for me.  I have not had any problems with hookup, video clarity or sound.  It seems to have good audio and resolution.  I have it hooked up to an older tv (almost 20 years old) and I have not had a problem.  However, I do not like the remote control and I do agree that there are too many buttons crowded on a small remote.  I use a universal remote and that controls my tv and vcr.  However, I just inherited a GE fullsize camcorder and am trying to figure out how to playback my tape from the camera into my tv using the vcr.  My tv does not have the audio and video jacks since it is quite old.  Any suggestions.  I seem to have lost my vcr manual also, so I am at a complete loss.  Any suggestions or tips will be greatly appreciated."

Horowitz manages to perfectly match the writing style of the Conan Doyle stories, gets the characterization pretty much right, and has concocted a gripping story as well. To my mind this stands up against any of the originals."

It takes several steps just to check the time.  I liked the behind the head ear phones, they don't pinch my ears, but I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.  The ear phone sound quality is just average.

After using them for 2 months or so I think it's time to tell about my experiences. First you should know, that the MG version sounds much better and also seems to have a much better radio tuner, which is suitable for mobile use. The ordinary Nomad 2 has a more useful display, but the sound really sucks. Overtuning and cracks during radio playback are a steady companion. On contrary the MG Nomad 2 sounds remarkably better (actually as good as it looks) and the finish of the hardware is top quality comparable with SONY standarts on mobile devices. But beware: Handling is a real mess. It will make you crazy accidentially pressing various buttoms on the mg. If you are about to choose, take the much more expensive Nomad 2 MG. At least it sounds good and is the best visual design availlable on the market. The ordinary Nomad 2 is a 100% disappointment and a shame for Creative's hardware line up"

I had done a lot of research in reading reviews and such. On zdnet and amazon, although the amazon editorial reviews are hardly ever negative at all.  Some of the major flaws that people had with the Nomad didn't bother me much at all.  I saw that some people had trouble getting the memory card out. I'm not sure what the problem was, as I am easily able to slide it out with my thumb WITH the battery in and plop it back in. Now it isnt something you can do upside down in the dark .. but this is nothing that qualifies as a flaw.  Volume.  I don't see what the problem was with volume as I can easily turn it up to where its just too loud.  Maybe the flaw lies in the ripping program that Creative bundles with it? I dont know.  I have no problem with volume controls.  Removable memory seems to be another arguement with this player.  Althought 64mb BUILT-IN would be very nice.  The removable smartmedia card does just fine.  I just bought a 64mb smartmedia card from amazon for my digital camera and Nomad .... Now this isnt a GREAT price but smartmedia is certainly coming down in price and this is a good thing.  Soon you will be able to swap these in and out of your MP3 player/digital player like cassette tapes.  On-board memory will soon be fairly insubstantial.  I did expect the Nomad to be slightly smaller but, I can understand the size due to the large and easy read LCD display.  I really dont have a problem with the size, just expected it to be smaller.  Ah yes. a few more points. The FM radio also seemed to be weak as others have said. I can still get my three favorite Fm stations pretty clear here in chicago and thats all i really care about.  Lastly .. the belt clip.  If you are working out its not so good to attach to some workout shorts if you are going to do some heavy running but, other than that it works just fine."

That caused the battery to die and be unchargeable. Once I figured out the problem, I depressed the button, recharged the unit, and went back to business as usual. I love my Palm Vx!! Is there anything comparable?  If so, please email me at delecia1@cox.net"

The Palm V was going to be the winner because of the sleek looks.  When I went in to purchase the Palm V, lo and behold, they had  the Palm Vx for sale also.  I special ordered it and had to wait about 10  days for it, but it was worth the wait.  Please don't be jealous, I got it  for $375 including tax."

I decided on Clie and was partly swayed by the high Consumer Report rating.  However, I was not able to transfer the data in my Palm desktop software to the Clie!  Sony said I couldn't have two versions of the Palm OS on my desktop, so I would have to remove my old Palm OS before putting in Sony's Palm OS.  If I did that, my data would be gone.  I asked them if I could transfer my user file to the desktop and then cut and paste the info that way.  No, I was told, the new software would not be able to read the files."

I raced through this enjoying the twists of the plot, and the stylish recreation of so many of the features of the stories like the use of a 'cunning disguise' to escape from prison. Totally implausible of course if you like realism in your fiction. Maybe one two many twists at the end, and too many coincidences all round, but I enjoyed the entertainment very much."

He does an admirable job and the story is evocative, thrilling and full of lots of twists and turns. It's also surprisingly touching and tries to be faithful to the feel of the original books. I was wary at first, but it turned out to be a great read and a version of Holmes that's more recognisable than the quirky and macho film versions you see more and more often nowadays."
8550,1409133826,R1B27SRGTSYZQG,,,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 19, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"I've been both an Anthony Horowitz fan and a Sherlock Holmes fan for many years, so naturally when I heard about this book it found itself on my must read list and I wasn't disappointed. It was exactly as I expected it to be given the author's back catalogue and the original source material. Is it as good as Conan Doyle's original works? Well it's different, it has a different feel and a different energy but its recognisable as a Sherlock Holmes novel. More recognisable than the Downey Jr films definitely. The plot is decent and has one or two interesting turns, I guessed part of the solution but I didn't get all of it so there was a decent pay off at the end. If I had to name my qualms about it they would be that it felt like there was a bit too much fan service, there were a couple of characters who appeared and who didn't really need to be there, one in particular who was pretty much there just for the sake of being there. There were also a few too many mentions of the original stories, references to events and people again which didn't really need to be there. My other major annoyance with the text was it at times became a bit too much like a social commentary on the condition of the poor in Victorian London and it was a bit heavy handed in this respect. But overall it was an enjoyable read, it's not a Conan Doyle clone but I didn't expect it to be, it was a Sherlock Holmes story as told by Anthony Horowitz. Just as the movies are Sherlock Holmes as seen through the eyes of Guy Ritchie and all the myriad of adaptations and non-Conan Doyle penned books have different approaches. It is an accomplished and worthy edition to the Sherlock Holmes mythos, and as I said a very enjoyable read."

Santa had taken advantage of the wildly popular $50 rebate/amazon coupon combo! Having owned the Palm for a few weeks now, I thought that I'd write a review, from one first time Palm owner to those who might be considering it. First and foremost, it's FUN. It's just a nifty little toy that comes in extremely handy on a daily basis. Secondly, it's _really_ easy to use. I kept reading the word ""intuitive"" in reviews when I was shopping around, and that's definitely true. I was thinking about getting a Visor because of the Springboard capabilities, but I decided, as another reviewer, that it'd be better to, say, buy a seperate MP3 player, of better quality no doubt, if I ever felt the strong urge for one, rather than add on to my PDA. The Palm IIIxe's large memory really does increase your possibilities for use, if you're a little proactive and sniff around on the web for some neat third party software. I've got AvantGo on mine, which is a must. News, weather, movies, stocks, you name it, updated every time you HotSync with your desktop when it's online. I live in a large city, so I also got Vindigo, which is a great little program that lets you search for restaurants, movies, stores, and the like close to your location. I recommend their web site -- they have a demo that's just like the real thing. I also got CSpotRun, a free doc reader that I use to read ebooks. There's a lot of free ones out there -- mostly older works that aren't copyrighted. I also have a city map from Mapopolis, and some games, of course, to pass the time. As far as the stuff that's included in the Palm, it's all pretty self explanatory. It's great to not have phone numbers on the backs of envelopes scattered around the house any more. Graffiti, the handwriting software that Palms use, is extremely easy to learn, and there's stickies included with the characters to stick inside your case should you forget something. It's obviously not as fast as typing, though, so the ability to type stuff in at your computer and then HotSync it to the Palm is very helpful. The infrared beaming is a neat little feature -- my boyfriend also has a Palm so we've beamed one another shopping lists, etc. Soooo, I've only owned the product for a few weeks, so I haven't encountered any long term problems yet, should they arise, but overall I'm extremely pleased. It's fun, it's compact, it's easy to use, it's helpful, it's a way to get organized from addresses to shopping lists to to do lists. I like my Palm. So sue me."

It has and energy, passion, and a will to live forever. I bought this DVD on a whim as I knew it would be ""artsy"". I have little appreciation for such presentations as, I think, commercial success tends to get in the way of conveying the true expression and history of a people. The complex choreography and drama is entertaining and exciting. I saw the Michael Flaherty production of Riverdance on PBS and it was sort of interesting but a departure from, what I understood, was the foundation of traditional music and dancing in Ireland. I must admit that my purchase was mostly with the hope that Jean Butler would be showcased an given a chance to really ""show off"". This did not happen in this DVD. She is good enough to steal this show with her real abilities but she also works quite well with partner Colin Dunne who seems to have more fun than Michael did. Fun is what it's all about.  Still, this production offers enough in it's own right to be worthy of consideration for purchase. It may take several viewings and, perhaps, some research into Irish folk history to gain a full appreciation of this offering."

The original Riverdance, however, is a thrilling ride - a lyrical tale of the evolution of dance set against the Irish struggle for Independence.  For sheer magic, however, you don't need to be Irish to appreciate the beauty and grace with which this story is told...both in music and dance.  Although newer companies may visit your town every year around St. Patty's Day, the original Riverdance is a coup of the human spirit - a dizzying swirl of gosamer feet that seem to lift off the stage.  Seeing ""Riverdance"" in person during its first incarnation was easily one of the top 10 highlights in my own theater loving life.  But - instead of splurging for tickets to a sub-par production, I heartily recommend watching this DVD first.  That way, you'll experience the magic as it was meant to be experienced and then be able to decide if you really need to see it on stage.  Beware of poor imitators like Flatley, whose ""Feet of Flames"" is a bit over the (narcisistic top) --- just plug in this DVD, crank up the volume, and bear witness to the original one-of-a-kind thrill-ride that IS ""Riverdance.""  I bet you'll find yourself applauding after most of the numbers, and unexpectedly starting a standing ovation in  your living room before you even know it!  An astounding musical dance work of art!"

The joy of Riverdance is apparent in  the interplay between the performers, masterfully captured in this video.  When the dancers are enjoying themselves, the audience feeds on the  enthusiasm, and a performance becomes a memorable event.  Riverdance - Live  from New York City is just such an occasion.

I've gone to the Franklin system for Palm for 2 reasons.  One, it gives me a DAILY to-do list in addition to my MASTER task list.  The second is that I can list my tasks A1, A2, A3... and B1, B2... to at least 50.

You don't have to think  about recharging it--just put it in the cradle at night when you sync with  your workstation, and it charges up from the day's use in just a few  minutes.  I've never had mine use more than about 15% of the battery  capacity.  The Palm fits in my shirt pocket, and the fold-up keyboard  (sold separately) actually fits in my front pants pocket if needed."

It's got a sleek design, not too trendy so you don't have to worry about it going out of style.  With 8MB of storage, you can hold enough numbers and appointments for years ahead.  Pitchblack conditions are not a culprit for this device because of it's backlit display, think back to the Indiglo Timex watches and that's pretty much what the backlit display looks like.  Contrast adjustment is on the case which is much more convenient then navigating to system settings on the PalmOS.  The cons about this PDA is it's expandability (no memory upgrade slot), but if you are going to use more memory for a PDA, then you might as well upgrade to one that supports MP3-playback, image, and movie support because 8MB is more than enough memory to get the job done for many years ahead.  I know people who have been using the original Palm V model (2MB) for a couple years and they've got their lives planned inside of that little thing for quite some time.  If you want to get this Palm to keep track of people you know and remind you of which appointments to keep up with, this is a very good choice.  Just remember to archive your Palm data on your PC onto a disk."

The Vx has some very cool stylings and easily looks better than any other palm in this price range hands down. The rechargeable battery is a plus, since it doesn't require constant replacement of the battery. The screen is normal size, instead of the smaller size found in the m100 series, and the backlight works OK, although it's only really useful in real dark situations. The backlight really just makes the letters fluoresce. While there isn't any expandability like a Springboard, the compactness and efficience of the Palm OS means 8MB is enough for nearly everything: the System is under 50k. By contrast, PocketPC's base system is 2MB, while all the standard applications bring the total to about 9MB. There is some expandability as a lot of accesories were created for the V series, such as GPS or modems. And there are a LOT of applications designed for the Palm OS available right now, so you can put that 8MB to work!  AvantGo, a program bundled on the install CD and available for download, is a really useful program, allowing you to catch up on the news while waiting in line or otherwise not occupied.  The serial cradle is technically slower than USB, but it is decently fast for hotsyncing.  A USB adapter is available if you don't have a serial port, but there may not be any speed increase."

I don't back up or charge the thing every day, so the super long battery life is a really big plus for me. Besides that, I think the Palm OS is excellent.

So moving on to The House of Silk was a good but at the same time, strage experience.  Don't get me wrong, the book is a good read, and Horowitz almost gets it right, but there are a few little niggles that make you do a 'double take' which reminds you, you are not reading Conan Doyle.  Anthony Horowitz has been clever and careful to use 'period' vocabulary, but  references to a 'Swimming Pool' and 'Tarmac' don't quite ring true.  It's not that these things didn't exist, it's the usage in a Sherlock Holmes novel that doesn't seem quite right.  I also felt that there are a couple of situations that Holmes finds himself in, that Conan Doyle wouldn't have let happen.  It was always going to be difficult for Anthony Horowitz to write a Sherlock Holmes story, but if I'm honest,  I'm not sure anyone could fully capture, or impersonate the style of Conan Doyle."

Look at it that way, and the price is a  bit steep?  BUT. Look on the web. Many many website devoded to the Palm  PDA.  On all these sites are THOUSANDS of programs and documents.

I downloaded a database, document reader,  secure memo pad, games and games, documents, magazines, ebooks, and with  one service, you can download any of hundreds of specially formatted  website documents, like news, weather, magazines, etc.  Again, it is  incredible what this little device does.  Then there is hardware for  it...modems, KEYBOARDS, etc.  Cases galore.  Many programs use what is  called ""conduits""....connection to the Palm and it's data with PC  applications of all sorts. I have the bible, many magazines, books, short  stories...all sorts of reading material on my Palm.  When I read them, I  delete them and go get more.

The Palm IIIxe has over a month of battery life (compared to several hours with Windows CE), never crashes, and is so easy to use.  It syncs really well with Outlook 2000 and Outlook 98.  No problems  whatsoever.  I especially like the wide range of programs you can get  online for free or at a small cost.  Windows CE could not do that.  Now to  the Palm IIIxe itself.  I think this is the ""best value for the  buck"" Palm there is right now.  Sure, there is the Palm IIIc and the  Palm Vx, but they cost [more than this unit].  All three have 8MB of  RAM and the updated operating system.  The IIIc has the color screen, but  why do you need a color screen in a handheld?  If it is for playing games  in color, then you are wasting your money.  The Palm Vx is exactly the same  as the IIIxe, except it has the new style, but let me ask you this.  Why do  you need style in an organizer?  You may say that these two models have  rechargeable batteries, a feature that the Palm IIIxe does not have, but I  have been using Nickel Metal Hydrate batteries (NiMH) on my Palm IIIxe and  the work very well.  Get some more information from Palm users about their  experience with NiMH batteries....  After you answer those two  questions, you will agree with me that the Palm IIIxe is the best value  Palm out now.  I chose the IIIxe over the Handspring Visor Deluxe for  several reasons.  First of all, in the Visor Deluxe, you cannot upgrade the  operating system when new updates are introduced.  Handspring, however,  says that you can add in a Springboard module to upgrade the OS.  But how  will the device operate later if you switch the Springboard with another  one?  No more OS upgrade, that's what.  The IIIxe has flash memory so you  actually upgrade its operating system.  Second, I have read several user  comments on the Visor Deluxe.  Several people are saying that the Visor  screen breaks much more easily than the Palm IIIxe's screen because of its  flimsy case design.  Palm put the normal sturdy case found in the III line  on it's IIIxe.  Second, tons of customers have complained about  Handspring's customer support.  I remember one person said, ""There is  none!""  I am very satisfied, however, with Palm's customer service,  especially their online customer service.  Take a look for yourself at the  Service and Support section at the Palm website.  So what do I use my Palm  IIIxe for?  I use it at school to keep me organized.  I am a very busy  person, but the datebook helps keep me on track with my appointments.  Also, I store my assignments on my Palm using a program called Four.Zero.  I play games occasionaly, but that was not the primary reason for buying my  Palm organizer.  The primary reason was ORGANIZATION."

I was so used to using a calender, another electronic organizer and good ole paper to keep track of my everyday work.  Since purchasing the palm IIIxe, my life has been  simplified.  It is so easy to use and its compact size makes it easy to  take around wherever you go.  What is really impressive is the ease of the  Palm's menu.  You literally just tap the screen on an application you want  to use.  The graffiti feature takes some practice but once you've gotten  used to it, it's a breeze.  I especially enjoy using the hot sync to  download my e-mail for later viewing.  Entering information in the address  and date book is fast using the accompanying software on your home or  office PC.  You just type in the information and hot sync it to your Palm  with little effort.  I think that anyone considering to purchase a Palm PDA  should consider the IIIxe.  It has a generous 8MB or RAM, twice as much as  the IIIx as well as some added new features.  I contemplated purchasing the  IIIc because of its color feature but later changed my mind.  I could not  justify paying an additional $200 for the color feature.  The IIIxe gives  you the most bang for the buck.  I highly recommend this item for those  seriously considering purchasing a PDA and to to purchase it from  Amazon.com.  They were the only ones who have it in stock and it arrived at  my door after only two days of placing the order."

Packed with featuresgalore, this MP3 player has an upgradable platform to support more than just MP3s for future use.  In another words, you most likely will not need to buy a new MP3 player for the next couple years. But as great as a product that this is, I still think you should wait until the Creative JUKEBOX comes out, which would be the MP3 player of MP3 Players.  It features a laptop 6.4 GB 2.5 inch hard drive that can take over 75 G's of shock, all in a rather convienient CD-player like package. Although when released it will come out with a hefty [price tag], think about how much money that will save you in the long run considering [the cost of]a 64MB Smart media card from SansDisk.  If you add the cost of the MP3 player and a couple of smartmedia cards you have spent well over $600.  The battery life will be shorter on the JUKEBOX, though, you say.  Yes it will be, but not by that much, considering laptop hard drives operate at a need to use basis... in another words they don't spin constantly, only when you need to access a song. It loads it up into memory and then shuts off pretty much. For me, that's not a problem because this thing is probably going to be sitting in my car most of the time. Yes, 6.4GB is a lot of space, but considering I go to college with a T3 connection and 100Base-T LAN, downloading MP3s are a sinch and also take up a good 20GB on my drives! Not to mention some other features about this device, such as support to play other file extensions like, MP3, WMA, WAV, and so on, and EAX Surround Sound, blah blah blah...  so much stuff. But again I say.. the NOMAD II is a great product, but you should wait..."

It has completely changed my way of listening to Music.  Its portable design makes it invisible in almost any setting, not to mention its light weight which is great for working out.  I take my player with me everywhere I go.  It has amazing sound quality and can take a good thrashing too.  I have dropped it many times and it has kept on ticking until recently.  I bought some 9$ head phones at Kmart to use with it and I kid you not it is like walking around with an invisible home stereo system on your head. crystal clear sound!!!!  no listening unit can offer a more customized and personal experience.  When I turn it off it remembers exactly where in any song I left off. if anyone else knows of a player that can do that for under 200$ please tell me.  I love this feature. If I turn it off for an hour and pick it back up its like I never missed a beat in the song (literally).  Sometimes the unit does some strange things but always bounces back. It can be difficult at times, but taking the battery out and putting it back in ususally does the trick.  Voice recording feature is quite useful.  Software user friendly, and it is so easy to use Iwas using it without even looking at it within 2 days of owning it. Now here is the bad part.  mine just stopped working recently.  It would not read the memory card and now I cant even get it to turn on.  I am crushed.  I am in the market for another one but I just cant find one that matches this one in features, portability, and sound quality.  I am leaning toward buying another one, and this is after thoroughly studying many other players.  I just cant get over this player and I dont think I will ever own anything else.  This little player rivals my wife in its significance.  very hard to find a light weight portable,good sounding mp3 player with voice recorder, FM stereo, no skip, repeat 1 and all tracks ,a-b loop, with auto song bookmarking feature, that runs on only 1 battery for many hours on end, and makes a 10$ set of headphones sound like a million bucks.  its ease of operation almost requires no instructions.  If mine doesnt start working again soon I will not think twice about dropping 200$ to get another one!!!"

I called Creative, only to be told that I have to order a new one because the 3 month warranty has run out.

The sound quality is great like all true MP3 players it never skips & the volume is nice too. The headphones feel great, the bass and treble can be changed to your liking, the wire is way too short, even with the remote, but the remote is great and handy.  The player is held easily held and navigated with just one hand. Its VERY nice looking.  The transfer rate is fast. With 64mb You can fit about an hour(not two hours like it says at nomadworld.com) of CD quality music,using .wma(windows media audio) you can fit about two hours.  Only complaints that I have are that it dosn't come with onboard memeory, you can only have a maximum of 64mb of memory, the main menu is hard to navigate at times, and that the display is green although it works fine. They aren't real problems, I'm just picky.  The FM radio is good but its not as clear as a car radio at times.  The voice recorder is very handy and you can have a five minute message with just 1mb. If you are planing to get it, its a good idea to get the NOMAD II DOCKING STATION, its not nessary at all but it nice and easy to hook up your NOMAD II and even comes with a rechargable battery. Overall its the best MP3 player for the money, delivering great sound, looks, and extras. If you got some questions about the NOMAD II feel free to e-mail me. I'll try to answer it."

I already own a top of the line portable CD player with the best  anti-shock system (to avoid skipping) and the idea of having to deal with  computer hardware was a bit intimidating.  However, once I began tinkering  around with Mp3 files on the Internet I found that the process is intuitive  and the sound reproduction is almost too good to be true.  And it may be.  As I write this review Napster, the most popular of the Mp3 download sites,  has been shut down by a preliminary injunction issued by a California Court  for possible copyright violations and piracy.  Trust me, the main reason to  buy one of these little gems is for downloading free music from sites like  Napster, Scour Exchange and CuteMX.  Ripping your own CD (using software to  transfer music from your own audio CD into an Mp3) is nice because you can  create CD quality audio files in a truly portable and skip free unit, but  the real draw to buying an Mp3 player is the ability to get free music from  the Internet.  If you ever just get an itch to hear an old song or preview  a song before you go out and buy the entire CD it is a phenomenal tool!  However, the music industry has declared war on this type of file swapping  despite the fact that over 80% of university students (by far the largest  group of Mp3 downloaders) said that the ability to download music would not  deter them from purchasing the studio recording.  Beware - the legal  watchdogs are really on top of this new technology and the possibility of  long, ongoing lawsuits to resolve issues regarding its possible regulation.  However, it seems ironic to me that lawmakers have done little or nothing  to control unfettered access to porn on the Internet but have reacted with  such alacrity to the issue of access to copyrighted music.  Ah, the power  of the almighty dollar."

Other reviewers have discussed details of the live v. recorded performance, Colin v. Michael debate, etc., none of which I feel qualified to add to, so I will focus on what stands out for my family. What had stuck in our minds the most from our TV viewing was the fabulous tap duel between the newly arrived Irish immigrants and the streetwise New York natives. Our collective memory did not play us false; it is truly a dynamite number. One terrific piece I had not remembered (maybe it wasn't on TV?) was the fiddle solo. I even got inspired enough by seeing this again to order tickets to a live production coming our way early next year! The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the kids find some of the singing and slower dance numbers boring."

Should some tragedy occur with your palm, you only lose information entered since you last synch! PROS: small, light, rechargable battery, synchronizes with Outlook, 8M, stylish.

I definitely have not been disappointed (and neither has my work, considering I saved them at least $1000 by getting this instead of a laptop.  I love the compactness of this Palm and the ease of transporting it from meeting room to meeting room and then HotSync'ing the info my PC as soon as I get back from a meeting.  I'm also impressed by the fold-up keyboard (see my review for the Palm V fold-up keyboard on this site).  The only disadvantage (and this is no big deal to me) is that if I play Solitaire on my Palm with my stylus for more than 30 minutes or so, the screen sometimes freezes up and I have to do a soft restart (I have yet to do a hard restart); however, I see this as minor in nature compared to what my old laptop used to do (freeze up in the middle of meetings and I would have to do a HARD reboot).  All in all, very convenient product."

I own a IIIxe, an m500, and a Handspring Visor Deluxe, and the Vx and the Visor are my favorites.  The 3.5.3 OS on the Vx seems to be rock solid-no crashes or freezes. The construction also is very solid. It was made in the USA, which I suspect is the reason for the high quality. Beware of PDA's made in China! The case on my m500 (made in China) became loose not long after I bought it and when I tried to tighten the screws they just stripped. I also get good battery life on the Vx, about a month per charge. With all the problems I read about concerning the latest generation of Palm PDA's, I can't help but think that Palm peaked with older models like the III series and the Vx. You really can't go wrong with the Vx, especially at today's prices. You'll have a reliable PDA with enough memory to add plenty of applications and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Tip: if you want the Notepad app on your Vx (or older Palm), download Notes! 1.1 for free at palmgear.com."

This new sensor seems more solidly built - heavier and well sealed against weather.  To replace the sensor I removed the entire light from the fixture box, unscrewed the sensor from the plate and cut the 3 color coded wires.  Then I matched the colors of the new sensor to the wires I just cut, black - black , white - white and brown - red.  My sensor came with a brown wire not a red wire as the match to the red wire of the light.  I used simple insulated crimp connectors - available at any big box store, possibly even Wal-Mart."

Worse, it's really hard to open and insert CD's while driving.  The mechanism to open it must be slid while keeping your hands from blocking the opening of the lid.  A near impossibility to do with one hand while watching the road.  It has a spindle inside to press the disc on (sopposedly to enhance the anti-skip function).  Try doing this while driving!

Although the amount of memory being supported in the mean time is limited to 64mb, it's still big enough if managed right.  For example, I converted all my mp3s into wma (which still just as great, if not better); about 30-32 songs in wma format were able to fit into the included 64mb.  One question though, my card lists its free memory as 62.5mb; why is that?"

The other features, such as fm and mp3 capacity are not as important. You may not know this but companies right now are working on ways to restrict mp3s. Other players such as the  rio 500 and the old nomad cannot be re-programmed. If the mp3 format is  changed by some security company so there will be less copyright  violations, these new mp3s won't work on the old players, but if you have  this player you could simply download an upgrade. Even if the entire mp3 format is eliminated, the nomad 2 can be  re-programmed for a new format! The wide use of the mp3 format just started  recently and lawsuits are coming in from everywhere, I don't want to pay  for something  that is useless in a couple of months of use, I don't know  about you."

I live in San Francisco, and the  performance of other radios (walkmans, clock radios, boomboxes, etc.) has  always been quite bad.  I found the Nomad II's FM receiver to perform as  well if not better than any of the other radios I own, including a Rotel  stand-alone component on my home stereo.  The only thing I find  disappointing in the package has been my inability to control the  ""titles"" of the MP3s as they disply on the Nomad II.  A minor  quibble, and they might fix this in future software upgrades.  You will not  be disappointed by the Nomad II."

But no, this was more than a mp3 player. It's a FM radio and voice recorder too. It wieghs 3.1 ounces. That's pretty light. The head phones are so comfortable, I don't even know they are there. Also, the player is so resistent to movement. For example, when I go jogging, I can actually hear the song. Not just parts of your song. It's about half as big as a cd player, and is digital. My cd player is going into the garage sale. In addition, it's attractive. All my friends are always saying how cool it is.  I recently bought the Nomad 2 docking station. It's great, because it recharges the battery and instead of plugging your player into a USB Port, you just pop it onto the docking station. Although, the rubber plug is a pain to get back in.  3 words to describe the Nomad 2 would be: Light, Attractive, and Convienient!"

It's not color which I don't care about, but I am having a bit of a hard time seeing the screen well.  I have had a terrible time getting it to synch correctly with Outlook and I couldn't get it to synch at all with Palm Desktop 3.5.3.  No clue what the problem is, but after 2 hours trying to figure it out, I just gave up.  I use Outlook Express, not Outlook and it took a lot of trial and error, but I can get it to synch names and addresses, but I can NOT get email to work since i don't use Outlook as my default mail handler.  So..if that fits your situation and you want to synch for email and download from AVantgo, then do not buy this.  However, I just want it for names and addresses to replace an old trusty Sharp Wizard that they don't make anymore.  I really loved my Sharp though.  What i like about the Palm IIIxe is that it's battery-operated (2 AAAs)- i honestly don't even fathom why people complain about this feature - they're nuts.  The battery operated PDAs are the way to go because they can last forever in your purse and you don't have to remember to charge it.  If the battery is dead while you're on the go - just run to a convenience store and buy AAAs.  That simple.  The Palm IIIxe seems pretty sturdy, but we'll see in the long run.  Either with Palm or Sharp, this beats carrying around a paper and pencil organizer.  The person I bought from on Amazon was great and honest too."

When I upgraded my computer and tried to install the cradle and the hotsync program, the computer did not even booth, it just went dead.  After 25 minutes of a long distance phone call to Palm support service (no toll free number), they told me the problem was the port, so they could not solve it - the port was working. I wrote an e-mail explaining the problem, the answer two days later was I did not give enough information as I did not tell what hotsync program I installed in my computer - NONE!!!, they clearly did not even bother to read the nature of the problem.  They saw a missing field and they just assumed they could not help. Eventually, after the level of complaints Palm received on the issue was large enough, they informed via the website that some cradles are defective and they need to be replaced; however, the part cannot be ordered via web or e-mail, support had to be called.  Another 40 minute long distance call, and I was informed that in 48 hours the cradle adaptor will be in my house.  After 10 days without adaptor, I sent an e-mail to support asking for it, giving it the service order number.  The answer was to call parts, an 800 number, only 15 minutes of my time were wasted before I was informed I needed to call support, as parts had nothing to do with it.  Another 20 minutes of long distance to order again the part, as the service representative made a mistake in the previous order, so it could not be processed.  When I asked for the order number they informed me that their database is down and they are just filling orders by hand and they could not give me a confirmation number. Good luck if you still decide to buy this."

8790,B00004RC2D,R5APHTN4DSA5C,A great deal for a lot of machine!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2000",59 people found this helpful,,"The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems.  I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm.  The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo.  Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available.  For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system.  Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software.  I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point.  With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine.  It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other.  By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer.  I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do.  You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings.  First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc.  If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice.  (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.)  Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us.  Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries.  This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power.  One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function.  He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision.  Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use.  Highly recommended!"

No more post it notes with  lists of groceries to buy or books to look for at the library. This is  handy, compact and a breeze! I was expecting a little organizer instead of  a powerful computer.

Panasonic would be right up there.  And it's not hard to see why.  I recently received one of the beauties for my birthday and I don't think I'd be jumping to conclusions if I said that this is the best cd player I've ever owned.  THIS CD PLAYER MAKES BATTERIES LAST.  And the anti-skip is un-parralled to any other.  And what's more amazing is it's durability (not a listed feature)  I unfortunately dropped mine about a week ago... I was heart broken, because I though I had broke it.  But to my surprise... it played as good as it ever did.  (Just take my word on that one...don't try it for yourself)  And since I'm a native of Wisconsin, I (along with this cd player) am subject to brutal cold in the winters and all kinds of not-so-electronic-friendly weather.  This cd player has endured through it all.  I have decided to dub this as the ""FRANK SINATRA OF PORTABLE CD PLAYERS""... way to go Panasonic."

The Palm Vx is by far the most effective and stylish of all the current PDA's on the market.  The unit is small and easily fits in my front pants pocket.  Half  the time I don't even realize its in there.  The 8mb of memory is perfect  for people who use some of the more memory intensive applications (like  avantgo).

It is extremely compatible with Top Producer which is an exhaustive Real Estate program.  I don't know what I would do without my Palm.  It contains absolutely everything that I have done in Real Estate for the past 4 years.  (I had an earlier version of the Palm).  It has every single address, phone number, appointment, dates of conversations with Customer/Clients plus the transcripts of those conversations, financial information, reminds me of appointments and meetings.  Extremely easy to use the graffiti.  I can't understand why anyone would want to lug around a fold up keyboard.  If you get stuck there is already a keyboard that is part of the unit. I was surprised that people lost all their information.  No electronic gadget is perfect, that's why you have to back-up with your computer.  I synchronize every day.  Sometimes twice.  Just depends on how busy my day is.  When I go on vacation I take my palm with me instead of my laptop.  It has every bit of information, personal and business that I could ever want.  My main piece of advice to a new PDA owner is to throw away your paper agenda, learn the graffiti and get moving.  It's fantastic!  The only thing that I find detrimental is the glare of the screen.  I purchased the film that goes over the screen and the glare is now gone. I do want a color palm but have no reason replace my Palm Vx other than I would just like color!"

I couldn't have been more mistaken, as it has doubled my productivity overnight, earned me a promotion, and allowed me to schedule my commitments much more effeciently. And that was before I loaded Docs to Go and Project@Hand for linking with Word and Excel and Microsoft Project for running my projects from wherever I am at the time. Just having the jobs list and calendar always at hand made an extraordinary difference. Now I can examine and edit project work on the fly, on a bus, up a ladder, in a plane, wherever and whenever, and then hotsync to produce a presentable document, create job sheets and expense accounts etc, at my convenience. For personal use I have not one but two entire Bibles which, with the search routines, make it a very powerful tool for Bible study anywhere and anytime. And there was still room for the Noah Lite dictionary. It is remarkably reliable and has never hicupped. The battery charge lasts at least a week to 10 days with normal use, so I virtually never have to think about it. I am glad I didn't buy a battery model. After seeing two PalmIII's destroyed on account of damage to their screens, one scratched and one smashed, I would strongly recommend using the protective screens and the leather wallet style cover. My only complaint is that the power button is too easily switched on for a device that gets carried around in trouser pockets."

Let me tell you, it has good bass, the batteries don't suck up that much power, ESP is long and it's pretty compact and lightweight. Looks good too with the silver. However, if you are a little rough with it, it might not play another day. I dropped this puppy several times in the first two months. After one big drop exiting my dorm, it could never play again since the plasic hinge broke off, thus making the CD door harder to close. I couldn't play it anymore! I gave it two stars because of it's lack of durrability. It's a great player, but be VERY careful with it!"

My last player didn't do that. The sound that this baby puts out is amazing when I connect it to external speakers. I can't believe it's coming from a portable. The only problem is that the display does not have a back-light, so if you use your player in dark places a lot, you may want to consider a different model."

I got it to replace a Panasonic portable CD player from 1994 and was pleasantly surprised at how much better it is. The battery life is WAY longer. I haven't actually counted,  but the 16-hour advertised battery life sounds just about right. I used to  use the AC adapter all the time with the Panasonic, but I don't even bother  with this Discman. ESP works great to prevent skipping, and it rarely skips  under normal conditions even without ESP (my old player skipped constantly,  especially in the car). The sound is great. There's two bass settings,  megabass and groove. I find groove to be TOO bass-y, but megabass is just  right. The only feature I really miss is backlighting on the display when  running off AC power. The Panasonic had that, and it made using the player  at night in a car a lot easier. Also, when you hit pause, the player beeps  regularly and frequently. This is good because you don't accidentally leave  it in pause and chew up all your battery life, but it's really irritating  when you've paused it to talk to someone and you keep hearing this beeping."

One bad thing is that I've found that it doesn't read cd's  that I've burned and it can't read the next track on burned cd's.  My old  one could, so if you live on custom cd's like some people do, I'd ask other  people to find one that does.  Also, it tends to skip, even with the ESP  on, if it is sitting vertically in a backpack pocket (ex. all those niffty,  new cd-loving backpacks).  All in all, it's a good cd player for most  things."

The Palm IIIxe is rugged with an integrated flip case, has more than enough storage space with 8 mb, allows you to upgrade the OS, and offers exemplary battery life.  Very nice examples of this model are available now for next to nothing either used or refurbished (some even new in box).  Ask yourself why do I need a color screen to keep track of my appointments and address book?  Why do I need a rechargeable battery that will give up on me in 3 years, when I can run my IIIxe for over a month with cheap disposable batteries?  Why would I want to try to surf the Internet on such a tiny screen?  Why would I want a wireless phone, PDA, and camera all built into the same expensive unit when I already have a phone and camera that work so well?

I was also an old Sharp Wizard Daytimer Organizer.  For those of you who remember, it had 256 KB of space and also had synchronization software for your PC.  I loved that organizer.  The only complaint I had was that it was sometimes difficult to enter info on the keyboard quickly, and I had a lesser memory unit before that was not durable.  I have to admit that after ordering the Palm IIIxe on a whim, I have been most pleasantly surprised.  I was concerned about learning how to write on the screen.  The graffiti was not at all difficult to figure out.  Within 3 minutes I had it down pat. I love synchronizing my email.  Now, I can just read it on the go rather than sit down and take 30 minutes in the morning before leaving for work.  This alone saves me a tremendous amount of organizational headache.  I just can't say enough about the Hotsync feature.  My only complaint is the lighting on the screen, it's just simply not as well lit, even with the backlight as my old Wizard.  I've also heard others complain about their screens. For the reason that the font is so small, I can't get see getting one of these for anyone who has any vision problems. I'm looking forward to getting to know my new organizational buddy.  I really hate to quit using my Wizard, but the Palm is just so convenient and advanced........I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to transition to PDAs."

When you look around, all the new PDAs offer way too much features for a real PDA. Bid deal, you can use wireless, and surf the web...etc. But come on, why would you want to actually surf the web on such a tiny screen? Look at the battery life on the new PDAs, you have to charge very often (2-3days) compared to the Palm IIIxe. With 2 AAA batteries , this handheld can easily last for 4 weeks (not days). Also the new PDA require you to change the battery approx every year (you can still use it, but you have to charege it every second, as the battery's ability to hold a full charge will continously decreasing). Those special rechargeble batteries easily cost $60 usd +, and the Palm IIIxe uses AAAs, which cost the fractions of those special batteries. It has all the feature a PDA should have, address book, appointments, calendar, and many many add on softwares(like a graphing calculator,games...). A Palm IIIxe can't let you watch movies, listen to MP3s or surf the web, but it help you to meet your daily tasks like any other PDA will do. If you want a true PDA, not those ones that you have to upgrade every year in order to keep up with the newest OS (namely Windows Mobile) and games offer, or spent $$$ on batteries every year, then go get yourself a Palm IIIxe right now, it's a ultimate PDA for the real users."

Plus, with the C it seems as though Palm  is building more on the III platform - no immediate worries about being  obsolete.  I organized a move cross-country, started a new job, and kept  sane thanks to this organizer.  Names are easily found and categorized,  dates are remembered, and life seems a bit saner.

She used it constantly for 45 days, and loaded it up with everything she could think of.  Then... it died - touch screen wouldn't accept input.  She called Palm (take note of the other reviews here with the long calls, and no 800 number).  They told her they could ship her a ""refurbished"" unit to replace it, but she wanted a brand new one (after all, it was only 45 days old and she treated it like gold - no scratches or any other abuse).  They couldn't do it, so she opted for the refund.  To make a long story short, about 20 phone calls, people promising to call back, couldn't find the paperwork from the ""other"" Palm service center, etc... it took 3.5 months to get the refund.  Since then, I've asked around at work and found about 60% of the Palm 3 owners that recently bought their units have had their units die inside the warranty period (one just yesterday, was 8 months old).  No similar problems with the Palm 5 or Palm 7, only the Palm 3's (E, X, and XE).  Apparently, when demand got tight, Palm QC went out the window on the 3 line.  No similar problems with 2 year old + Palm 3's either.  My wife loved (and still does) the OS, and the unit itself, but she will not buy Palm again, after the runaround she (and apparently others here) received.  She will be buying a Handspring or PocketPC - we're not sure yet - but NOT another Palm.  Ask around, you may be surprised at what people are thinking before you buy."

Uhh, the headphones aren't all that great either :( so go get some better ones...they sound ok, just uncomfortable. other than that, you can get em [really inexpensive]... and memory, headphones only cost me... more... still a great buy. mp3 players are great...download the latest, greatest songs you like to listen to, then delete them when you get bored of them. Its great, no more wasted cd's of ""Robs Mix"" or whatever...hehe"

It has the  most memory; more memory than the Palm VII that has internet access. It is  the smallest and lightest. By attaching a modem to the Palm Vx and hooking  it up to a cellular phone, it is the same thing as the palm VII but has  more memory, is smaller, lighter, has more accesories, and is better  looking.

Only one drawback; apparently a lot of folks out there agree with my assessment and I am currently in the market for a new Xv as this device is also a popular item to steal and refurbish!!

I originally decided on  the V series because it seemed like it would be more of a ""road  warrior"" type of device. It is. I have had no trouble with it  whatsoever as far as minor jars or bumbs go. It is small enough to fit in a  pocket easily without being uncomfortable and its size also allows you to  jot down memos with relitive ease while you are walking (just don't forget  to look up every once in a while). I found that the graffiti writing system  is absolutely amazing. I have now abandoned pencil and paper completely for  notes as I use a memo and the graffiti and I can take notes just as fast,  if not faster. For diagrams and things of the sort, you can download a  diddle program that allows you to sketch nearly anything. After having this  for a couple months, I see no real design flaws and the advantages of it  are nearly endless.

The BEFSR41 is my personal favorite, and am glad to have gotten it at a decent price here.  I definitely recommend this router.  I got this one refurbished, and there's nothing wrong with it at all, save for some minor issues setting it up.  UPnP port forwarding is one of its features I'm glad to have, uTorrent showed all green for connections.  I have not noticed any drop in network speed, like with a few other routers.

Re-setting the router and the modem made no difference, I could only get connectivity when I plugged the modem directly into the PC.  I assumed the router was at fault, but when i tried a new one, that did not work either.  I did some digging and after some help from Tech Support, I realized that the problem is that the router has to be reconfigured.  You basically have to go to the set up page (there is an http address that is supplied in the instuction card) and when you get to LAN setting be SURE to hit the button that says ""clone MAC address""...that is what I failed to do (who knew it did NOT refer to MacIntosh Computers?) and was unable to get access until I did that step.  So if your router stops working and your modem is still operative, don't assume the router is bad, the setting just may have been lost.  I originally gave this a 1 star because of that failure but since it was a technical issue (and one I feel should be prominent in the insrtuctions) I am giving it 3 stars."

The SL-SX270 is a wonderful CD player. I just  bought one for my daughter (her old Sony finally died), to use primarily in  the car when we go on trips. Well, this does not skip at all. We went on a  three hour trip, over extremely bumpy highway and back roads, and the  Panasonic was flawless! This trip to our cousin's house caused many a skip  with her old Sony, which in fairness, had only a 10 second antiskip. The  Panasonic is small, lightweight, looks great, and comes with an AC adapter.  My daughter was at first attracted to one of the ""cool looking""  CD players from another brand, which costs a little less money and also  carried by Amazon.com, but it has very mixed reviews. We decided on the  Panasonic for its reputation - which was absolutely the right decision. It  works wonderully well and even plays are own-made CD-R's!! Its just not  worth taking a chance to save $20. You can't go wrong with the SX270!"

So I bought one.  It turned out to be this one, and I liked it right away.  The anti-shock function, the Random and Resume features, and the Hold feature alone are enough to warrant buying it.  The S-XBS feature, IMHO, *MUST* be used if the sound is going to be worth it.  This player has made many trips with me, across country, as well as back and forth to work and the gym.  Sadly, it is dying.  The anti-shock function sometimes simply causes the cd to stop playing, though still spinning.  The cute part is that when this happens the player actually apologizes; the word ""Sorry"" appears on the LCD screen."

This Panasonic cd player is smaller (a plus)  and is well built and feels like it will last.  Sound wise, it can't get as  loud or as clear because its output level is 9 milliwatts a channel  compared to the Sony's 15.  Its sad the portable cd player manufacters  don't put this number on the outside of the box because, just as you see  how much power an amplifer can produce so you can see before you buy, so  should these portable cd players.  But, this cd player is great for what it  was designed for, active use.  You can ride a bike with them, walk, run,  mow the yard, ride the bus, and anything else you can think of that doesn't  involve water.  Oh yeah, the bass boosts aren't that good ethier, because  it distorts the bass a little and makes it muddy, but It's hard to tell  unless you use good headphones"

Now there are cheaper ones, many of which I have tried, but they suck. This one however works flawlessly. It is easy to use...good product without the price tag of sony--which are also good but a bit expensive. My favorite thing about this CD player is the 'button-popup' cd relese. There are some problems that prevented me from giving it a perfect score: 1) The bass boost is weak compared to some other brands, (sony has a multi-level base boost has has a couple different bass boost settings.) 2) The button are sometimes pressed when you don't want them to if they are kept in tight areas such as a pocket, but that's the purpose of the hold button ;). 3) The volume 'dial' is not in the easy position to use (not a big problem at all, caused no real problems). 4) the cover open slider is easily inadvertently triggered, but the 'button' method (used by sony, and most other manufactures) is even  worse."

Also If you want to change something on the settings the radio/mp3s turn off if your listening to them. The flash card is also hard to take out with the battery in. One more thing -- the headphone look like they are for a little kid! they are really small even though they go on the back of your head. it's kinda weird, I had to use some old ones. But other than those ... 4 things it's great. I mean the radio and voice recorder make up for some the bad stuff. I mean it's great! You can record up to 4 hours! that's cool!

I was always thinking of a Windows CE handheld computer and never paid much attention to Palm computers. Then, one day, just a month ago, I bought the Palm IIIe (because it was  affordable: $149) thinking that I was just getting a ""monochromatic  electronic organizer"" in the meantime (unlike a full-color Windows CE,  etc.), but to my surprise I had a little powerful computer! I was hooked in  less than one day and I even bought the PalmPilot book by David Pogue.  Two  weeks later, browsing the Net, I saw the newest model, the Palm IIIxe, and  comparing the features I ordered it immediately. What I like about the Palm  IIIxe, just to mention a few things, is its 8MB of memory (which in the  Palm OS world is really A LOT), the upgradable operating system (unlike the  Palm IIIe), the 2 AAA batteries that last on average 3 weeks if you use  your Palm a lot, thousands of programs to download and of course the  one-button sync with my PC.  Other than the basic functions, I use it as a  database browser, dictionary, quick reference for book titles and URLs I  keep jotting down, my repository of ideas (including small sketches),  financial calculator and to download customized channels from the Web to  read later on.

The Palm IIIxe, what can I say, no other handheld better represents Buddha's middle path better. Here you'll get the 8MB you so desperately want.

It has the darker pixels and high contrast pee-gold back for the ultimate in clarity. It has a built in conduit for Outlook users. The only reason you might get made fun of by those well-todo suckers at the office is that you don't have that nice re-chargable lithium-ion batteries, and sexy 11mm thin body. What do you care? You're no tree hugger and there are plenty of AA batteries to go round. 2 AA will last you about a month. Now that you're looking at this product, I've deduced that you may be dumb enough to watch pro-wrestling, but you at least know better than to toss away your cash on an M100 or IIIe. However this may be just a stop off before you check out the color palm. If you are considering the color palm, then chances are someone had to help you get online. At the color palm's price point you get backlighting, that true, but for what? So you can feel all superior tot hte IIIxe owners because you have a blue border on your schedule. Save your money.  If the IIIxe interests you, you may consider the TRGPro. It is a similar palm licensed unit with a built in speaker and a compact flash slot for use of up to a 1GB(via the IBM Microdrive). In closing the only sure fire way to know which is the best is to buy them all, or go with the Palm IIIxe the most well balance unit of all."

I went into this read with expectations that make my opinion unfair to the writer. There were a few things that surprised me right off the bat: This is a book of short stories though the longest story in the book is I Am Legend. The story in the book is absolutely nothing like the movie. Honestly, I don't know how on earth they pulled the movie script out of this short story they are truly NOTHING a like. In fact, this goes way beyond the cliche point of, ""the book was better"" or when you hear people complaining that the movie wasn't enough like the book, no, in this situation the literal only thing the movie and this short story had in common was the title and the fact that the world is overrun in an apocalypse setting. After that, the story-line of the movie and the story-line of this short story are so completely different in every way I don't know how anyone could even say that the movie was based on this. With that said, I was automatically disappointed because when I saw the movie I was excited to read the book because I thought the story line of the movie would have really lent itself to a good read. The story as it is is like all of the stories in the book - dark, depressing and hopeless. This is not the kind of book you read for a feel good feeling at the end of any story in it. Though I Am Legend (as a story) was written in an interesting narrative that passed time quickly it ended with a stale quality that I found was a theme with all of the short stories in this book. I would be surprised if anyone who read this didn't know exactly what was going to happen at the end of every one of these short stories. Which was probably the biggest disappointment for me, I may have had unfair expectations of I Am Legend as a story because of the movie but I had no expectations of the rest of the stories in the book. Sadly I found this entire read rather stale and just disappointing."

While I admit that you can't do much with it, like run or move around a lot, it has always worked well.  One time, I tripped and fell right on top of it (it was in my pocket).  The headphones broke, but the Discman didn't miss a beat.  I think that's pretty good.  My only problem is that if you simply tap the lid, it skips.  If you just want to listen to it in a car or something, get something to post it on and it will work fine.  If you want it for running or something of that nature, look elsewhere."

There's only four cables for a two computer network: 1)power supply which comes with the unit, 2)the WAN cable from your broadband modem, and 3)one ethernet cable from each computer to the router.  I'm no networking engineer, but I would say that it does take some computer savvy to properly connect and configure the device.  After about 20 minutes of reading the manual and connecting the router, I was ready to give it a try.  No dice.  So I called the support line.  After about 10-15 minutes on hold, a support guy professionally walked me through several procedures and we were up and running.  In this day and age of very poor support, I would give these people a solid rating.  In less than one hour from opening the box, I had a functioning two-computer network at home, and that includes the time talking with tech support on a Sunday morning!  I tested the ping rate before and after, and if anything, the connection rate is slightly faster now.  One of the most important criteria I give a piece of equipment is the question, ""If I had this to do over again, would I buy the same thing?""  And the answer here is, ""Yes""!  Good luck.  By the way, if you don't have them already, be sure and buy an ethernet cable for each of your computers to the router and one for your broadband modem to the router (In a two computer network, that would be 3 ethernet cables).  Crossover or uplink cable is not necessary."

I love the product, but my experience with the installation was different. I had no luck at all on my own (and I even read the product manual -- PDF only, btw, nothing on paper -- in advance). The installation program (run from the CD accompanying the router) was hopeless. It tells you to start by leaving the router out of the system altogether, and connect the computer to the internet directly via the modem, which I did. The program then checked the internet connection, and gave this report: ""Your router is already connected to the internet, and nothing further needs to be done."" How can this be? I wondered, my router isn't even connected. And when I did proceed to connect the router physically, the internet was inaccessible and the installation program would not work. So the installation program failed completely."

Its a small, low powered light at desk height and I thought it would make a nice night light that turns on when you enter the room. Its silly and frivolous, but it looks great as an incorporated feature. Anyway, I mounted the sensor under the desk and back about 8"" so it would be mostly inconspicuous. It is mounted between a cabinet and an undermounted desk drawer so it is installed in somewhat of a tunnel. I was a little skeptical about how sensitive it would be but it works great and turns the light on from almost anywhere in the room. It is very sensitive (which is what I wanted) and the field of vision is pretty awesome despite being located in a ""tunnel"". Thumbs up from me.

However I found the book almost ""unputdownable"" and enjoyed it very much. I hope the talented Mr Horowitz has another go. Bring it on Anthony !!!"

It's the perfect blending of the IIIe and the IIIx at a price point that can't be beat.  I couldn't  justify spending the extra money for the IIIc (who needs color anyways! )  or for the V (2MB is kinda puny), so I opted out for the IIIxe instead of  the Vx.  And it's great!  I've owned a handheld device before, but it was  large and cumbersome and the only advantage was that it was based on  something familiar, Windows.  The IIIxe is simple, easy to use and learn,  and very useful for that time when you need to write something down and you  don't have pen and paper.  I would highly recommend considering the IIIxe  if you are in the market for a Palm organizer.  It's priced right in the  middle, has the same features that the IIIe/IIIx has but more installed RAM  (about 8MB total), plus it's upgradable (although the Vx has the extra  ""coolness"" factor because of the slim aluminum casing).  I've had  mine for only two days now, and already it has gotten me out of forgetting  information that was useful to me.  So if you are looking for an organizer  and are debating between WinCE or a Palm, go for a Palm.  Much simpler and  easier.  Besides, why would you need a WinCE device that has a color  screen, limtied battery life, music playback capabilities (on a small tiny  speaker? ), and that dreaded Windows operating system (we don't need  another spawn of Windows...there are already too many right now with 95,  98, NT and 2000).  Palm IIIxe...the way to go."

Also, if you go to Palmgear.com, there is a nearly infinite amount of software you can get.  And since you have 8 MB of memory, you should not have to worry about running out of space anytime soon.  I have installed about 20 games and I have a lot of entries in my phonebook and calendar, and I still have about 7 MB free.

The HP's batteries have a life of about 1/10 that of  the Vx and it's just bulkey. The Vx is light and goes forever before  needing a charge-up.

After reading a bunch of reviews (thank you Amazon) and reading magazine articles, etc, i decided to go ahead and try some out at ... . The ones i was going to look at were the Palm Vx, the Handspring Visor Deluxe, and the Casiopeia EM5000. Even though the Casiopeia was great, with the applications almost exactly like Windows 98, the price swayed me away. So it was down to the Palm Vx and the Visor Deluxe. So I tried the Palm in the store, and liked it a lot. It was sleek and cool looking. The Visor Deluxe was really really neat too, but some reviews swayed me away. So i ended up purchasing the Palm. I took it home, and put all my apps on it (AVantgo, games, etc.) and tried to put my Outlook 2000 onto it. Figuring how easy the previous synchs went, i figured transferring my address book and calander onto my Palm would be a snap. But, instead, my Palm crashes, in the cradle, and it forced my Compaq Presario  laptop to freeze. After reseting everything, i realized my apps that i had transferred onto the Palm had disappeared. They weren't in the Palm folder on my desktop, or in my Palm. I loaded those again, and tried to get my calander and addresses onto it. Froze and crashed again. This happened 2 more times, even after i had my friend come over, who is the master of any technology, especcially handhelds. He said he has had some similar problems with his Palm Vx, but he didn't know why it was that bad. So after replacing the unit, i tried yet again to load my apps. Same thing happened. I hadn't even been able to use it for what i wanted, for keeping dates and assignments and contacts. By this time, the Platinum was released from Handspring, and i traded the Palm Vx in as soon as i could. And i couldn't be happier. The Platinum is the best thing since sliced bread. It synchs wonderfully, looks cool, and keeps everything organized. And the Springboard expansion slot it great too. Go for a Handspring or a Windows based PDA if you are in my perdicament. But i prefer the Handspring."
9205,B000031KIM,R2XYPLQ8F9ESZQ,Feeling very strange,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2000",20 people found this helpful,,"This is my first handheld. Now, I am feeling strange not only to Palm, but to all the reviews from the Palm experts and Palm users on the net. At the beginning, I thought I liked the device. The appearance was good to me (Everyone knows it). I could put it in my front pocket becasue of the light weight and the small size. The memory was big. But there were still something I didn't really like. The font was too small that I couldn't read the text clearly. The screen which Palm called it enhanced screen was not that clear. There was too much reflection of light when the environment was too bright, while it was impossible to read comfortabily at night outside the office. In fact, I could only use it in the office when I stood under the lamp. So, that meant I could only use the device comfortabily under normal indoor lighting. It was a big joke that the device was a handheld which was supposed to be used conveniently wherever you were. But I still felt alright with my Vx as it was my first handheld. There was much for me to explore on it. Everything was new to me. My mind have changed since I met my friend who had a IIIx. I tried his IIIx which ran OS 3.3. Surprisingly, it responded to the taps much much faster than my Vx. Actually, when I tapped on my Vx, the device likely needed some time to respond. I thought that's normal before I met my friend. But that made me worried as my friend's IIIx (without any overclocking) responded really at once. Then, I tried to explain to myself that might be the philosophy of the new OS 3.5 that Palm engineers might think that the immediate response to the tap was not important. So, I wrote a little program using Pocket C and ran it on my Vx and the IIIx simtaneously. The program was very simple, composed of some loops and made the device to print asterisks repeatly. Well, I ran it simtaneously on the 2 devices. The IIIx finished significantly before mine did. What do you guys think? Well, it was Friday night. The local technical support was off. So, I dialed long distant call to the US technical support. It didn't help at all with those voice answering machine. I tried to get an answer from the Palm support web site. There was no mentioning about this issue. Finally, I found the Assist Chat from Palm web site. I talked to the technical support representative on-line (don't want to mention the time I had been waiting). I told her my problem. She said it was abnormal that Vx was slower than IIIx and told me to take it back to the shop as I had bought it for no longer than 30 days. I was glad as I thought I got a chance to work the problem out. Then, I took the device to the shop today. They weren't sure if it is normal or abnormal. So, they told me to leave my Vx there and they would send it to Palm where the engineers would check it. I did so and leaved the shop. I went to another shop. I asked for a IIIxe and a Vx to have a look. I tried both of them. They both responded to taps as slow as mine did!! That meant my Vx was 'normal'???? I am feeling very strange. Why are the expensive Vx and the very new IIIxe slower than the old old old IIIx?? Strange! The CPUs of these 2 devices should be faster than the one in IIIx. So, why??? Strange! Is it the OS?? Both IIIxe and Vx run OS 3.5 while IIIx run OS 3.0 (my friend's IIIx run 3.3 as he upgraded). If that's true, why did Palm make a new OS which run slower than the old one? Strange! I say it's slow not only because of the response to the tap but also the Pocket C I wrote! And the strangest thing here is that: I have surfed the net alot and have read many Vx reviews from the experts and users before I bought my Vx. There was no report that Vx was slower than its ancestor nor report that OS 3.5 was slower than OS 3.3. It's real strange."

I had been using 4 port netgear wireless router to hook up everything and had already ran a wire to the basement of my house for the Xbox 360. When I added another computer in the basement I needed to be able to run an ethernet cable to it but didn't want to run another cable to the basement. I bought this and hooked up the computer and the 360. I can use both at the same time and it doesn't effect the rest of my network upstairs. I still can connect the 360 as a media center extender and stream music from any of my connected computers. In summary this switch works exactly like I expected.

Clearly, it made more sense to get a new one, which has a 2 year warranty.  The only problem is that old and new have the same model number; they key is the version, whicn none of the retailers including Amazon list or even know.  However, it turns out that virtually any unit shipped in the last year or so, will work with Vista.  I had to use Linksys technical support to get the link to the online patch that enabled me to install this one -- forget about the installation disc -- and everything is again working."

At first I was having all kinds of trouble because my DSL connection uses PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing.  What was happening was after a varying amount of time, my DSL provider (Earthlink) would change the IP address during my session and the router is not able to recognize the change and therefore, it hangs.  You then have to unplug it and reboot your computer.  I have read about other people using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing having the same problems.  It was getting frustrating.  After messing around with this router for several days, I have finally discovered settings that alleviate this problem.  I'm sure many people will find this helpful, and it will save you a lot of aggravation if you are using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing.  First off, you need to flash the latest firmware to the router.  You can download the firmware at the Linksys website  Make sure you have at least Firmware version 1.36 or higher.  In the web configuration utility, enable Connect on demand, and check the Keep Alive box.  Now, here is the most important part!  Set the idle time to: 9999 minutes.  It lets you login to your DSL provider and keep the same IP address for over a week.  Try it out!  Maybe this tip will work as well for you as it did for me!  This router is fantastic and the speed is incredible!  It is the best router you can get for the price in my opinion.  Even if you don't know the first thing of networking, you can figure it out, it really isn't as hard as you imagine it before you purchase it.  Once you have it, it seems to explain itself, and is extremely easy to configure.  A great device to add to your office or home network.  Definately 5 stars!!"

It takes care of PPPoe, connecting and authenticating as it needs, so your system is under the impression that you're connected directly to the network (through a proxy, of course). Which is great, because I always hated dialing up - even if only takes seconds. Plus, it puts you behind the linksys firewall, making you virtually impervious to any attack (no more cpu-cycle eating firewall applications)."

9275,B00004RC2D,R2VYIK0L8VQTFE,This is my 2nd Palm device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2000",56 people found this helpful,,Here's the kind of great things you can expect from a palm device.
9276,B00004RC2D,R120PWOK1CPF7H,"Intuitive, simple, and useful",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2000",,,"I don't like hype. But the Palm IIIxe is intuitive, and simple, and very, very useful. It's kind of like opening the smallest present under the tree and proving that the best gifts come in small packages. For years I've written myself notes on scraps of paper, pasted Post-Its on the refrigerator, kept refilling Daytimers, made to-do lists on my PC's, left messages for myself on my answering machines, and sent myself email reminders. But this little unit has replaced all that. It's great. It takes a day or two to catch on, but it is so intuitive and and so easy once you get the hang of it that you'll soon be recommending your Palm to your friends, your family, and total strangers. The neat thing about the Palm IIIxe is that it isn't bogged down with a lot of frills. It's not a web device. Get something else or use your pc if that's what you want. It is a very organized organizer. Here's what it's got: A calendar, by day or week or month. Notes. Contacts, addresses, multiple phone, fax, etc., to-do's, memos, etc all with your definable categories. It's got search and find utilities, configurable preferences, etc. Reminders, alarms, infrared transfer of a business card to another Palm, etc. It comes with desktop software for your PC so you can back it up regularly (called HotSync), and I recommend using this religiously because it isn't fool-proof. You'll get used to the stylus and entering data with it in no time. If you've got a bunch of text to enter, do it on your PC and then HotSync it over to your Palm. It's small, and light and not bogged down with a lot of junk. Throw out your Daytimer, let the dog eat those Post-its, and let the vacuum cleaner suck up those scraps of paper. Pick up one of these Palms. Highly recommended. We bought these Palm IIIxe's for our business and can't stop raving about them. Yikes! That's a lot of free Palm promo, but I really do think this is the coolest thing I've seen in years."

I couldn't stand the thought of not being able to upgrade and having just 2 Megs of memory on my system.  The IIIxe is everything I hoped it would be.  I easily got it  synced up with Lotus Notes, and am able to track all my appointments, all  my To-Do's, and can keep all my various project notes in one place.  I've  already exceeded 2 Megs worth of memory (mainly because I like to read and  I've begun to install e-books) and yet the performance is unchanged; as  fast and reliable as ever.  Finally, the batteries seem to last forever.  I've been using my IIIxe constantly for 2 weeks now and the batteries are  still mostly charged.  Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with  product.  A great price gets you lots of memory and all the features you'll  need for personal and business use."

No, you can probably live without it, but once you have one, you won't think you could again."

I keep all of my work hours in the memo section, since I work part time and my company is known to have screwed up paychecks in the past.  I have a leather case with velcro that opens like a book that makes my Palm easy to access.  I love my Palm IIIxe, and have had it for seven months now with no problems.

The unit doesn't seem to allow the sharing of a single IP address and that's all my Roadrunner ISP allows for each account. So, if you're in SoCal and are with Roadrunner, I suggest you get a router. Linksys has a decently affordable one--the Linksys BEFSR41 4-Port Etherfast Cable/DSL Router. Check it out. But not to beat this puppy with a shovel, it's not a bad switch. File transfer rates between computers through the switch aren't too bad and it's a cinch to install. Just remember to check all your network settings. Peace out."

It would seem that Linksys 5-port switches are affected, though there may be others.  I've personally seen one completely fail and another three with issues.  Of the three, the common theme was high packet loss.  I finally replaced the two I owned with a Linksys/Cisco SRW244G4 managed switch.  My network performance & stability improved significantly.  Plus the 4 gigabit port were an added bonus.  Personally, I'd avoid buying any of the consumer-grade switches Linksys sells.  Go with Netgear, DLink, etc.  If you're looking for a business-grade managed switch, the Linksys/Cisco ones seem well built and trouble-free."

The main advantage, for most users anyway, is that a switch provides optimal bandwidth to all ports, whereas a hub splits available bandwidth between all active users.  This means that if you are sharing a cable modem for example with others in a house/office building, connection speed will not be reduced when multiple users connected to the switch are online."

It works fine for sharing an internet connection with computers running modems, but you can't share a DSL connection...I recently signed up for a DSL hookup and the phone company guys said I had to replace my Linksys EZXS55W switch with a Linksys BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router.)

I have not had ANY problems with it at all. Tranferring the songs onto the player is quick and very easy. It says in the instructions that you have to install the Real Player onto your computer to work it, but Musicmatch also works with the Rio, and you can reduce the bitrate for mp3 onto it, meaning you don't have to convert to wma format. I reduce mine to 64 kpbs, and it sounds great! There are only  two reasons I did not give my rating a 5 star:1) it was only 32 mb, and you defintely need 64 mb, to enjoy the player to the fullest. So, I had to purchase an extra 32 mb backpack for it, but the extra backpack came with a rechargeable battery, and an adaptor, so I don't have to worry about buying new batteries every week. 2) I wasn't too impressed with the earphones that came with it, so I bought another set, which worked out great. I can fit 30 songs on this player, which is just fine with me! This is a great MP3 player, and I highly reccommend purchasing it!!"

It is more than is necessary for appointments, addresses, etc., but not enough to run any real software.  The memory is NOT upgradeable so you are stuck with it until you decide to throw out the Vx and buy a PDA with enough memory to be really useful.  The Vx cradle is expensive to buy a second one, but that is the only way to recharge the battery or connect to your desktop computer.  Don't forget it will cost you even more if you want to hook up to a Mac, and you can't hook up to a USB port.  If you are getting your first PDA and only want addresses, appointments, and games then get a less expensive PDA and PLAN to throw it out in a year if you find you want more power.  Even the least expensive models can do everything the Vx can.  If you know you want something more than addresses and appointments then DEFINETELY get another PDA.  I suggest something that has the ability to be upgraded so it won't be outdated by the time you figure out how to use it.  (...)"

Keep in mind that the firmware is upgradable, i.e. if you don't mind working with .bin files and flashing EEPROMs through the router's internal setup page you can keep it updated very easily.

Following the CD to INSTALL it, is essential, and easy to do.  But there is no manual, no quickstart guide, and no trouble-shooter that comes with it.  All of those things are on the CD; limited as that is.  And to make personal settings, refine it, or trouble-shoot it; you have to go online, and do research.  The internal settings can be VERY complicated.  I'm attempting to use it for my TiVo to transfer recordings from my TiVo to my PC.  It is taking almost more work than is worth the effort.  The Router itself works exactly as it should.  Since there is no manual, and findind Linksys Tech Support is very difficult; I'd suggest finding a good tech support place online, read it, and see if you want to delve into all that this type of connection may require.

I was concerned that I would have problems because I had to deinstall existing setup. For internet sharing between 2 pcs, I was using Winpoet software with Microsoft Internet sharing activated and two network cards in one pc acting as the server. The existing setup was clunky and the main pc had to be on for the other pc to connect. Before setting up the Linksys router, I took out 2nd network card out of the main pc and deleted it from the network listing. Also uninstalled WinPoet software and Microsoft internet sharing. After that, shut down everything hooked up network cables, turned everything on, used the Linksys web page setup and within 5 minutes I was connected! Both pc's too, together or separately; and performance is way better now!"

However, the DHCP server appears faulty.  Occasionally, I get an IP Conflict when a new computer logs in.  In addition, when looking at the computers that have DHCP-assigned IP addresses (through the administration access), the reporting is almost completely erratic.  For example, almost never are all the computers shown, and refreshing the screen has no effect.  Linksys tech support has verified this is not working properly, but has no solution.  PPoE to log into SBC's DSL works great, and port forwarding is also passable, though you have to assign a static IP to the devive you want to route to (rather than the MAC address or device name), which is a bit of a pain.  Overall, for the price, it works pretty well."

Then they said they would charge my credit card for the full MSRP until they received the failed unit, plus I had to pay for the shipping back to them.  I refused, talked to a supervisor, and still no joy.  The shipping would cost me almost as much as a new unit.  This feedback is not just about the EZXS55W.  It's about the company in general.  They represent the typical greedy big business with their attitude concerning customer service and their products fail too often.  I had two of their routers fail as well.

I only had a slight problem  setting up the AvantGo software (offline reading of websites) because of a  firewall setting problem where I work. Otherwise the setup was very smooth.  The Palm hotsync'd with Outlook both at home (via dial up to work) and at  work. I would recommend buying some sort of protective case right away. I  also have now ordered a hotsync cable to use at home since I've been  leaving the hotsync cradle at work. Now that I have the AvantGo software  working, I want to be able to hotsync at home as well. It's nice having  some stuff to read say on a long car ride....and it's so much nicer having  the Palm rather than hauling around a big laptop. The real beauty of the  whole thing is that everything is backed up...by that I mean since we use  Outlook at work for e-mail and calendar and stuff, even if I have to reset  the Palm, or one of my kids erases/deletes something, all I have to do is  hotsync and I'm back in business. I'm sorry I waited this long to get one."

I was excited about this purchased and eager to organise my life. Right away it had problems. In the first 24 hours I had it I spent over 3 hours on the phone with Palm customer support. These were a sad group of individuals. They kept having me try the same things over and over again. My problem was the Palm Desktop would Hotsync, but would not send my datebook over to the handheld. I was getting angry and telling them ""look, I'm just going to return it, there is something wroung with it."" ""No,"" they said, ""we can fix it its in the Palm desktop not the hand held."" So I went over and over the same backing up of data and resetting the handheld and reinstalling the software with three different support persons. Finally, I said ""Look, I have the info I have entered in the desk-top backed up. I'm just going to return it for a new one."" Finally the Palm support guy admitted to me that, Yes, The handheld was defective. By this time I wanted nothing to do with the Palm Brand, But I did not want to lose my Information I had already entered. So I returned it for another Palm IIIxe. This one appears to work fine. But, The entire ordeal of going around and around with their customer support has soured me on their products. I'm glad I don't own stock in Palm!"

As a novice Palm IIIxe user, I've found it to be very easy to learn and use.  As a long-time Franklin Planner user, I have been able to retire my planner.  The Palm is simply always there - to check the calendar, to make a note, to make a calculation, to take meeting notes, you name it and it's available.  The biggest problem I have is deciding which of the hundreds of software applications to try.  My Palm is with me from early morning until I go to bed at night.

I quickly found that while the stylis graffiti is easy to work with, and very accurate, I can take notes faster on paper. Other than not being able to take notes at a reasonable speed in class, it does everything I want it to. The operating system took me about 10 minutes to master (I had no prior experiance with the Palm). Syncronizing with my computer is easy-there's only 1 button on the Hot Sync cradle and it takes an average of 15 seconds to syncronize via serial port, unless I'm installing applications, which there are a ton of free ones on the web. I wouldn't bother with the USB connection kit unless you don't have a serial port. This Palm IIIxe features everything the IIIc does, except a color screen and a built in rechargeble battery. The Vx is the same as the IIIxe, except thinner, a rechargeble battery, and more expensive. The VII has a modem, which you can buy seperatly for the IIIxe. Unless you want a color screen, don't bother with the other Palms. Get this one."

This was exchanged by customer support (who are great, but I later had a problem which they still have not answered, 3weeks).  I have almost maxed out the memory and use it for everything from contact, schedule, to do, and even my checkbook, and some medical stats. Use it with the modem for e-mail and minor net lookups.

The audio is great, the menu structure is very understandable, the screen has a light function that's very similar to Indiglo, and the casing fits your hand well enough that you can operate it with one hand.  Unfortunately, the Rio 600 has some flaws.  First, the Rio says it can run off one AA battery for 11 hours.  That's true in more than one sense of the word.  The clock inside runs off the battery, greatly reducing playtime.  Unless you use the Rio constantly, you're going to be changing batteries every two weeks.  Second, 32 Mb of memory is not a lot unless you convert your mp3s to Windows Media Audio (WMA).  To do this, you will need to download the powertoys package for the Windows Media Player, it does not ship with the Rio (at least when I got mine).  Finally, the control program you install on your computer to transfer songs is very cumbersome.  I have a part-time job as a computer lab consultant and even I have to look around in order to make the program work.  I don't even use it anymore, I just use the ""Portable Device function"" in Windows Media Player--which is a lot easier to use.  In short, the Rio 600 has a short battery life and a complicated control program, but makes up for it with an affordable price and excellent sound quality.  If you get it, I recommend getting the rechargeable battery."

First of all, im not sure if mine was defective but it would only go 2-3 hours of playing time before the battery would flat out die. I tried upgrading the firmware or calibrating the battery beforehand. This brings me to the quality of the design, when I try and get to the battery compartment. You have to remove the entire back cover and then open this other flimsy door to get to the one AA battery. Try and squeeze the battery in the small space while so worried that the small plastic holders are going to break off. One you got that in, you have to carefully position the back cover to fit back on with the metal contacts in place. Whew."

This is the first portable mp3 player I've gotten and I honestly love it. The 32 megs it comes with may not seem like much, but by recording music in the windows WMA file format I've been able to fit over 16 3-5 minute songs in it, and the reason for getting something like the rio instead of a cd/mp3 player is so that you don't have to worry about scratched discs & skipping.  This is definitely the best player for it's price range."

There is software  that allows you to download files using Windows Media Player 7, and this  works fine.  Windows Media Player also automatically converts MP3s to WMAs  (if you want it to, by setting the writing speed to 64mps).  It can also  transfer MP3s, but since the WMAS take up half the space and (to my ears)  sound just as good, why not use wmas?  I can get about 14 songs on this  way."

I was happy with all the features, the display, etc., but there are a few issues worth noting with this.  First of all, the battery doesn't last anywhere near the 11 hours it says.  If I leave it for any length of time without using it, the battery dies as well.  Then there is the memory issue.  I realize that is an issue with any 32 MB mp3 player, however, the memory backpack things are impossible to find; though the wonderful people at the store I purchased it at assured me I could order them online, that was not the case.  I suspect the reason they didn't have them at the store was that this model was on its way out. The website currently makes no acknowledgement of the memory ""backpacks"", and while they do still have software updates for the 600 model, they don't sell it anymore.  I have not been able to find them ANYWHERE.  If you want more than 10 songs, do not buy this."

Cool design, and easy to install and use software.  Music capacity is defintely skimpy, however.  MP3 format takes up much more memory than WMA format, so it helps to search for music in WMA format.  Even more helpful would be the upgrade, and frankly they should make it with the higher memory to start.  Out of the box I would say the memory capacity can sometimes be closer to 30 minutes than 60 minutes.  Biggest problem: after only a couple of weeks of using it, it died.  No warning, it wasn't dropped.  Everything appears to be fine except that no sound comes out of it.  Tech support was very matter-of-fact about the problem as if it happened all the time and said they would authorize a replacement, though I have yet to get the paperwork that will allow me to send it back.

She plays her tapes on it quite a bit (to the chagrin of her parents!) and it has taken a couple of falls but has held up well so far.  But I do have a few complaints. It is quite heavy once batteries are in it! The ""play"" button is pretty hard to push.  It took some practice for her to be able to depress it by herself but with 2 fingers pushing fairly hard, she can do it.  I feel the buttons aren't ideally placed as the large handle is right over them making it sometimes challenging for the less dexterious hands of toddlers to manipulate.  Sometimes my daughter inadvertantly blocks the door with her fingers when she is trying to eject the tapes and doesn't understand why the door won't open.  The microphone doesn't stay attached well so is always dragging on the floor. Plus, I think its a little pricey for a tape recorder geared towards children.  But, it does sound pretty good for a kids player and we're still on the first set of batteries after daily use for 6 months.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I'd buy this one again I had the choice."

It was perfect!!!  He uses it to record songs he sings to play back to me when he thinks I don't feel good, he records himself mimmicking his father's voice and reprimands his brother.  He then plays it back to my 11 year old's closed door.  He drags it out in the yard and records the dog barking at squirrels.  He then plays back his recording to scare the squirrels and, if they don't run from the sound, he throws the recorder at them.  He uses it to stand on in front of his television while watching his favorite shows, then records himself reviewing the show to play back to his friend at football practice.  It gets banged around, kicked, dropped, and stepped on, only to keep working flawlessly.  This was the perfect pick to entertain my little one, who is jealous of the electronics his older brother has, including a cassette deck he uses to record his friends and family for later playback."

At first, the sound would come out broken and intermittently and for some reason I thought it were the speakers that were bad.  Eventually it produced no more sound until I connected it to a boom box.  The toy is way too heavy for children under 35 lbs.  My son is 3 and he had trouble maneuvering this clunker while in his car seat (if only for a few weeks).  The sound quality is ok, the recorder is attractive and colorful, but all and all, this Fisher Price Toy does not live up to FP's reputation."

The short cord for the microphone causes a lot of feedback even when the volume is low prompting my son to say too loud!  I don't know why the fast-forward and rewind (who can tell the difference they way they're marked) buttons don't stay down.  It took me a while to believe they don't stay down by design, since even the play button requires so much effort to get it to stay engaged.  Definitely not kid tested.  The microphone falls out of its holder constantly.  This toy is so frustrating for me I can't imagine using it with the patience of a two year old.  Thankfully my son loves music and is still enjoying this gift.  Hopefully it will continue to work for a while, the build quality seems very flimsy.  Buy something else, I can't imagine it would be worse.  This is not anywhere near as good as the Fisher Price toys I remember from my youth."

At first, I was very excited about this product, because it is compact, lightweight and sporty. But after using this product I have found several flouts, one thing is the material the manufactures have chosen to use, it might be lightweight but it's too soft to maintain its structure. Sometimes the player would turn off by it self because the battery would separate and loss connection. Also the Rio 600 does not use flash media cards, instead it uses a memory back pack which is not currently sold in stores, and since the only way to upgrade your rio is to buy the back pack from Riohome.com,  Rio have managed a system that doesn't allow any competitors to create a similar product which allow them to push up the prices for this memory pack.

It's well designed so that it's small enough to take jogging and easily fits in the grip of your hand. However, there are numerous drawbacks."

Why? -Ability to easily update player ROM to support future music standards. -Fast USB connection. -Expandable storage medium using the backpack 32mb module. -Decent playlist manipulation. -You can use other programs (i.e. Windows Media Player) to download music to the player. -Lightweight design."
9518,B00004SPUN,RADA5VHPH841B,Great MP3 player!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2001",9 people found this helpful,,"For Christmas, I asked for a mp3 player.  I wasn't specific of what I got, but I did ask for a mp3 player that had cool features and it would be a good buy.  Well, on Christmas day I got the Rio 600 mp3 player.  It was great!  I instantly installed the software it included and started transfering songs to it.  But, I had a problem.  When listening to the mp3 player, in the middle of a song it will make a twerp sound, or it sounds like it is skipping.  I tried eliminating all the problems it could of had, and it still did it.  Well, I aks my parents where they got it and they said at Circuit City.  They also said that they were out of stock of it and it had to be shipped to the house.  So, I repackaged it and we took it back to Circuit City for a replacement.  Luckily they had another one in stock and in less then five minutes I had my new Rio 600 mp3 player.  When opening the package, I noticed that it came with a small carrying case (which the one before didn't) and my new one also came with more songs pre-loaded on the mp3 player then before.  The only thing I can think of is that the Rio 600 I got the first time, must have been a returned item and I happened to be the lucky one to get it next :)  Since getting my new mp3 player, it has been great and it sounds just like my CD's!  I took all my favorite songs from CD's and loaded them into the mp3 player.  I love it!  But, if you are going to order it from a store or something, I recommend not buying it if it's not in stock and they have to order it for you.  I would only buy it from the store if they have some in stock, doing this I hope you will save yourself some trouble!"

And yes - Windows Media program is definately the transfer program to use. But it works FINE with Windows XP - it recognizes the Rio the second you plug it in. Downloads are fast and easy !

If you MUST own a RIO get a 500 atleast you can use smart media cards.  Its bad enough that the 600 uses a RIO only method for expanding storage, but the design of such is bad.  They had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery.  The pins are very easily bent or broken when reloading batteries or upgrading the back panel.  The device is physically larger than it should be, and it is made of the WORST plastic possible.  A soft compound that would not be durable.  OVERALL BAD PRODUCT.  PLEASE SHOP AROUND.  AND CHECK OUT REVIEWS.  DIAMOND gets what they deserve for letting this peice of junk make it all the way to market."

Setting up the Hotsync was easier than a piece of  cake. I keep finding more and more reasons that this little gadget is  really useful! I really wrestled over this or the Handspring Visor...the  only apparent advantage that the Visor had was the plug in modules they  offer, and so far, they all seem pretty gimmick-y. I'm really happy so far  with the Palm.  After seeing all the useful things this thing does for me,  my wife wants one for herself, too! The only thing I'd like in a PDA is one  that is a slight bit smaller and lighter."

But I feel this is still not going to be good enough  since I am going to run out of memory soon.  Palm really needs to get its  act together and add more memory to its devices.  With the popularity of  the Palm devices and the thousands of applications out there (I have a lot  on my Palm IIIx and have now run out of memory), this is a major drawback  of Palm.  I considered switching to Compaq's iPAQ, but two things about the  Palm have delayed that switch (a) its robustness (doesn't crash like  Windows), and (b) the large number of third party applications that make  this a truly useful device all the time.  I use a Qualcomm QCP860 cell  phone and I can connect to my Palm anywhere, any time - check email, surf  the net, or use my Yahoo messenger.  But if Palm doesn't continue to  improve its devices I might soon switch to the Compaq iPAQ.  But until  then, I am going to be a loyal Palm user!"

Nothing else can compare with its features and price, believe me I've checked out everything!  I have had no problems, and it has been perfectly reliable and very easy to use.  There are so many software options available for this model that you can taylor it to do almost anything you want.  Just search the web for Palm software and you'll find tons of stuff.  I read a tip somewhere that suggested cutting overhead transparencies to size to use for a screen protector.  This works very well and I would recommend it to protect the screen.  I also purchased a Silkyboard, which is a screen protector/keyboard input device.  This device is absolutely fantastic, and I would recommend it to everyone who desires fast and easy entry into the PDA. ....  The only improvement that I would like to see for this PDA would be to shrink it to the size of the Palm V series.  But apparently that is quite expensive, because Palm Vs cost 2 or 3 times more.  I'll stick to the value of the IIIxe !"

It worked out of the box and continued to work well for me until early December.  I went and dropped the edge of the table on my airline seat down on the lcd screen causing it to shatter.  Sad mess I caused for myself.  Sunday morning I called Palm and opted for an exchange/repair to cut down on hassle.  On Tuesday morning I had a replacement in my hands.  It unfortunately had a stuck notes button on it but was in beautiful shape for a refurb replacement.  I called Palm again, they were sorry for the problem, and I had a new replacement unit in my hand on Wednesday morning that was just mint condition and worked flawlessly.  Great support and product.  Easy to read display with excellent battery life with rather long usage periods.  Will demand performance equivalent or better to this to replace my IIIxe with a different model."

It took the place of my huge day timer and note pad I carried around with me. So it's not color, the information is still the same. I have my camera cell phone w/web brouser, so I have it all in my purse. Recommend this item if you are just getting started. I dropped my last one and broke it and have missed it tremendously. It works great with my AOL calendar and email addresses. Type information into AOL and then sync them to the PalmIIIxe or vice versa.! It's so easy! I even include in my AOL calendar when my bills are due and they come up on my Palm calendar and I set timers for my bills payments and Doctor, etc appointments. I just can't imagine being without the PalmIIIxe. I also like it cause it is slim and fits into my small purse. The fact that all the information  is backed up on my home PC is great. When new one arrives I will be able to sync information to it."

Graffiti is not that easy to use.  I am definitely thinking of getting the keyboard to type in the huge amount of data (addresses and such) I need to reference.  Also a downside  not really mobile like the Palm V.  This was my first outing with Palm  after being paper and pen for years, and I would say that the Palm is  really worthwile if you travel, if you have a lot of contacts, and if you  are going to use it."

Like for example this thing is great with Xbox Live becuase maybe it is laging what this switch does is improve that lag sure it still might be slow but it helps it be less noticable..

He reported back that one of the gold pins that is located in the battery unit was bent, and it had pushed out the female side. It couldn't be fixed.

Treat it like you are inserting batteries in a 2000 year old artifact that will crumble if you are the least bit rough on it. Don't try to insert the batteries in a hurry, either.

There were a couple of things that unfortuantely didn't make it into the DVD version that were a couple of the many highlights for me personally.  The first was a part where a woman was crouched down and was spun around by her dancing partner.  The highlight here to me was the fact that she was spun around about as fast as the ice skaters spin.  I couldn't believe she could keep her balance while on one foot and be spun around so fast.

Writing in messages using the graffiti or the keypad is easy. It was well worth the investment."

This is the best value for your money in a PDA.  Its far more economical than the Vx or even V for that matter. I personally  like the looks of the IIIxe over that of the V series especially since the  IIIxe is jet black(versus the onlder III models with the gray case). The  case also seems more rugged and sturdy than the Visor series. Buy this!

I entered all of my personal and business contacts into the device with ease.  The 8MB really comes in handy when adding extra applications and games.  My Palm is already at 2+ megs which would have  been impossible for the 2mb Palm III or Palm V.  For the bucks this is a  great purchase.  If you have more to spend, go for the Palm color.  If you  have even more to spend go for the new HP Jornada Pocket PC with 32mb ram...the  screen and the sound is great but you lose some of the excellent apps  available for the Palm OS."

I love it!  I found Graffiti just a bit limiting, but I eventually downloaded Jot and the handwriting recognition is blazingly fast and super accurate. There are so many third-party software programs, you can spend hours browsing and downloading great add-ons.  I have tossed my old 5-pound Franklin-Covey planner in the trash and now I use my IIIxe for everything.  It's a great  companion at meetings for note taking, schedule and contact info  swapping, and even playing chess during those boring ones!

Make sure you get a good case to protect it (Rhino-Skin shocksuit sports case for me, and a Targus leather case for my wife), and Write-Right screen protectors as well. I've had mine for about 8 months, and the best thing about it for me is that I stopped messing with post-its, scraps of paper, business cards, address books etc. etc. Just check the Palm, it's there. As soon as I get another phone # or address, I enter it. I've read alot about broken screens, but this thing has survived 8 months at the fire station, around town and on trips hung externally in it's case on my safari bag, which shows the importance of a good case. Most screen breakage results from carrying it in a pocket or unprotected drops. Bottom line: it works for me, might go color in 12-18 months, but then who knows what'll happen by that time!"

When I received it, I opened the box to find lots catalogs and some documentation.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I realized it is OK for keeping contact info, and barely OK for keeping track of my calander.  Its not very intuitive, and required a lot of tapping in just the right places to get things filled out just the way you want them.  The display is readable in dim and bright light, but its so awful to look at, after a while, who cares.  The display looks like a cheap casio watch, which is why the battery life is very good.  The battery life is also good because its VERY SLOOOOW!  Needless to say I sold it, and bought an HP Jornada 548.  Wow, what a difference!  The last reviewer talks of clunky PocketPCs, but this is actually slightly smaller than the Palm IIIxe, though it does weigh 2-3 ounces more.  It is MUCH faster, and the resolution of the screen is fantastic.  The text on the Palm's screen looked blocky and when I tried to use mapping software, it was nearly impossible to make out anything!  I use mapping software on the Jornada and its just like on your home computer.  Absolutely beautiful and readable!  The Jornada even knows when to capitalize for you when your writing, and the text is so much easier to read.  The battery life is not as long as the Palms, but will last all day, and recharges very quickly (half charge just takes a few minutes on the cradle). I will never need to buy any more batteries for it.  After using the Jornada now for a week, it really makes me feel like the Palms and Handsprings are merely cheap plastic toys, that do nothing more than hold names and phone numbers."

I love how it allows me to carry all of my work contact information with me and only maintain it in one place.  It synchronizes excellent with MS Outlook 2000.

All the Lestat book are great, but skip, Pandora, Blood and Gold and Armand and pick up again with Merrick and Blackwood Farms the latter is in my opinion her best novel yet! Also, Laurell K.

Now, however, we no longer read much of value and are not much interested in God's truth and in finding the way to repentance and taking the journey to the Celestial City. Even many churches today seem more interested in Vanity Fair than the Celestial City. In our entire group at church, I was the only one who had read Pilgrim's Progress, and hardly anyone had even heard of it. However, they knew sports scores, actors, singers, etc. It is time once again to return to taking the things of God (and not just the latest church trend) seriously, as John Bunyan did. Once we follow Jesus, we need to continue on to seeking holiness as in Bunyan's follow-up Holy Way. We need to live and teach our kids to be separate from the world, rather than trying to imitate it or entice them to church by being like them."

Eager to know if I had made the right  decision, I began researching the features of the two. They both have  several unique things about them, but what the basic choice becomes is  upgradeable (Palm) or expandable(Handspring).  I don't even make a dent in  the memory in my Palm, so the option of expanding the available memory  didn't appeal to me.  Another idea to consider, I don't think the Handsping  has beaming capabilitites.  The only disappointment with my Palm has been a  quality issue (I've had to return it twice), which I have assured by  salespeople as being highly abnormal."

This is the greatest abuser of the three.  There are three major problems: 1) not filming the dancers full  body, 2) stage lighting (not the best for filming, though fine for viewing  a live performance), and 3) excessive changes in camera angle.  Of these  three, the second is forgiveable, being unavoidable if one is filming  before a live audience but one and three are not!  As to one, there was  extensive work done by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in the early days of the  musical that worked out the best ways to film dance.  Only one completely  ignorant of filming technique would fail to film full body.  As for three,  I can tell you that there are nine cameras in New York's Radio City Music  Hall.  How do I know?  BECAUSE THE FILMOGRAPHER SWITCHED CAMERAS EVERY  10-15 SECONDS OF EVERY FLIPPING DANCE!  HELLO, we do not ALL watch an  excessive quantities of MTV, thank you very much!  This is distracting at  best and at worst it totally disrupts the ability to appreciate the flow of  the movement.  Additionally, if you've already seen the Michael Flatley  film there is very little of interest or improvement (unless you dislike  his work, in which case you may like this).  The only major change is a  ""dance down"" pitting American tap against Irish step.  This  particular number, were it film properly, would be worth the price of  adding this work to your collection, even if it already included the  original ""Riverdance"", but, as it is, forget it!  Rent it on  video, see the number, and forget wasting you well-earned money on this  forgetable turkey.  The performers worked hard and I am sorry that those  filming them didn't give their effort the presentation it deserved."

Please do not waste your money on the New York show. There is too much choppiness in the camera work. Very little camera work from head to toe, which will give you the full magitude and absolute beauty of the dance movement. I believe the great Fred Astaire had stated that he wanted his dance steps to always be filmed from head to toe, to give the full beauty and grace of his dance steps. This video is ridiculous, to much cutting, head shots, feet shot's and even dumb camera shots from way back in the theatre. If you get Riverdance ""The Show"" you will see tremendous footwork and coordination that you can fully appreciate. I have seen Riverdance LIVE at the Wang theatre in Boston and at Radio City Music Hall. You have to see the full movement of the Riverdance troup to see the grace and skill involved. This tape does not give you that, does not allow you to focus, on the skillfull dancing to appreciate it, to see the grace of it all. The camera work tries to do too much and in the end completely fails at what it is suppose to pass to viewer, the beauty and grace of Riverdance."

I haven't tried it for music, but it's just perfect for audiobooks. The best part is that you can load several different books at one time, if you're like me and like to listen to several at once, depending on your mood. Audible.com's software allows you to load specified times to the player, so you can load one hour of Steven King, 3.14 hours of John Grisham, and so on up to 9 hours. The backlit screen on the front is easy to use, and as long as you hit stop before you turn off the unit, it remembers where you left off and starts there again.

It's unstable, doesn't reconize the player at times, and is really shareware junk. I'd suggest buying MusicMatch Jukebox or using Microsoft's Windows Media Player to do your uploading. Also, like other people, I've experienced sudden ""black outs"" when the audio just stops and restarts on its own. SONICblue (formely S3) really needs to release a newer version of their ""firmware"", the software that runs the Rio.

The sound virtualizer makes a song sound spacey, real raw. Now I know I said stick to Sony with portable audio but Panasonic is trying to come up.

It plays very loud and does not distort the music even at full volume like many boomboxes can.

XBS (adds punch to rock), Clear (clarifies higher sounds), Soft (for  background music), and Vocal (adds gloss to vocals).  The CD player is a  slide out drawer type as opposed to the top loading found on most  boomboxes.  The CD Player has all the features (Random, Repeat, 36 Track  Program).The tape player sounds great too.  The tape player is full logic  controls. What's cool about the tape deck is has a motorized ejecting  system at the touch of a buttton.  The cassette has different modes for  recording.  The only thing I wish it the cassette deck had is auto reverse.  The Radio is all digital and gets many stations with its long antenna.  You can preset 12AM and 12FM Stations and scroll through them buy using the  Jog-Dial.  The unit comes with a remote control that controls every funtion  including cassette.  If you want to use batteries the unit takes 8D for the  main power, 4AA for the memory back-up (Clock, CD player and preset  stations ect.).  The manual says the memory batteries will last about a  year.  You also need 2AA batteries for the remote.  I bought the 8D  rechargeable alkaline batteries.  I may have to exhange my unit because the  jog-dial seems to stick in certian spots I am going to call Panasonic to  see if this is normal.

It is cool and perfect in the applications you can use with  it (I use it to keep track of my patients medical data when they are in the  hospital).  So I took it back and got my money back.

While the synchronization with Microsoft Outlook succeeded most of the time, the reliability rate was about 90%. The other times the ActiveSync program just wouldn't respond and I had to reboot. This covers Microsoft PC application (Outlook) synchronization. At work we're running MeetingMaker as our scheduling software. Using Puma's IntelliSync software (about $80) I found out later that the Windows 2000 IP protocol is different from NT 4.0 so unfortunateley there was no way for me to synchronize to MeetingMaker at all (short of asking the sysadmin to upgrade every user in the company to upgrade to the new MeetingMaker version so that *I* can synchronize --> NOT). To make a long story short: I ended up selling my iPAQ on ebay for over $600 and I am happily using my Palm V again.

Recording is more suitable for things like lectures than musical performances, but if you're in a pinch you could certainly hook up a line in and record.

This recorder produces a fuller more detailed, natural sound than the smaller Sony cassette recorder. It operates on either battery or AC, but for some reason the sound is a little better on battery. Batteries last a fairly long time--longer than for the Sony. I bought the good-quality but inexpensive Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 Professional Moving Coil Dynamic Handheld Microphone (Amazon), which works well with it, but you need to get the adapter plug also, separately (Amazon has it). As another review pointed out, the only disappointing thing is that playback through headphones is on one channel only--if I want to hear it in both ears, I need to take the cassette out and play it back through the smaller Sony recorder, which does a good job for this purpose, although the actual recording process is better through the Panasonic, as is playback through the units' own speaker."

She has dozens of cassettes in shoe boxes that she loves to listen to, and she was very unhappy because everyone told her they don't make cassette recorders/players anymore.  Since she lives alone and is disabled, I knew how much those cassettes meant to her, so I set out on a massive search to find one for her, and ended up at Amazon, like I usually do.  I gave this to my sister with a brick of Sony tapes and she was so happy she actually cried.  She said that was the best present she ever got.  She immediately set it up and started playing with it, and didn't even want to go out to dinner as I had planned.  I finally got her out the door, but when we returned she wanted to use her recorder.  I had taken my guitar with me, and we started singing some old songs into the recorder from about 4 or 5 feet away.  She could hardly contain her emotion.  The recorder picked up all of our voices and the guitar very well.  It has good sound, no squeals, and she was thrilled.  To me, this Panasonic Cassette Recorder is worth every penny, and I'm going to buy another one as a backup in case they really do quit making them."

However, if you like  things simple, get a Palm.  While I love this product, it is not as easy to  use as a Palm (I have a Visor).  The visor is a bit easier to use.  The  only problem is that unless I get external modules, the Visor does not  match (not even close) to the capabilities of the base model of the iPAQ.  The problem with the Win CE operating system (or whatever they call it  these days) is that it is based on MS Windows and it is a bit awkward to  access some of the functions or programs.  I will continue to use my Visor  for business and the iPAQ for ""fun.""  I also wish that Compaq had  gone with the AA or AAA batteries instead of a proprietary option because I  have a AA/AAA recharger at home.

In fact, there's hardly any similarity between the two at all, other than the fact that the main guy is called Robert Neville and he could possibly be the last surviving human in the world. I actually thought the book was a good read, and Robert's daily struggle with both the vampires as well as his own despairing loneliness was quite enthralling. It's a fairly short book, and not much happens in terms of 'action' (I can certainly see why the movie was changed) but it is worth a read, nonetheless. Only thing I didn't like was the rather abrupt ending. There was no foreshadowing, no steady build-up. An event happens, and soon after the book is over. I'd give it a 3.5/5."

This must be the first book they've ever read because it is anything BUT suspenseful.  I gave it 2 stars only because of the concept, not the actually story line and how it was written.  You can sum this whole book up on a single page, double spaced, probably less...so I'll try.  Neville barricaded himself in his house after everyone turned into vampires ***SPOILER*** by bacteria ***END SPOILER***.  He worked on his house for a lot of the book, making it sound proof, etc., he ate through a lot of the book, and drank for even more of the book.  He fought with himself and his thoughts (obviously since he was alone).  He found a dog that wasn't affected by what was going on and had survived the vampires, so he lured it in for what seemed like an eternity ***SPOILER*** and then for it to die immediately after he brings this companion in to live with him ***END SPOILER***."

Unfortunately, the movie and the book only have the main charactor and the theme of the book in common.  I got 65% through the book still waiting for the big event of Neville finding some sort of possible cure and something more interesting than just his depressing musings.  To say the least the book does not give the movie justice....the movie is by far the better of the two.  I loved the movie and own the DVD.  Now if the book was as suspenseful as the movie, I probably would have finished the book.  I just got  BORED!  I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have seen the movie.  You will just be disappointed.  I will admit that the beginning of the book kept me waiting for what would happen next, but then it just got boring....get to the point already!  In the movie, they know what caused the 'Outbreak' of the vampire virus; Neville's wife and daughter was significant characters .  In the book it really doesn't even tell you anything about the mother, the daughter, and it portrays  that the dog (of which was a main character ) was just a stray dog and not the great, smart dog of the movie.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had seen the movie and thought it would be a great addition to it and also to my book collection, I NEVER would have purchased it.  It was very disappointing.  To say the least I DO NOT recommend this book."

Batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2001",3 people found this helpful,,This was the first portable cd player that I bought and waspleased with it for the first 3 hours. I bought this for ($) .... The price was the reason that I bought it. I read the reviews on Amazon.com and thought I was aware of all the downfalls. The sound output could have been louder for my tastes. The lack of a resume after stopping it didn't concern me. The shock protection worked well. In a car on my lap it didn't skip with anti-skip off. It took a good tap on the cover(anti-skip off) to make it skip. After a skip sometimes it took a little long to start playing music again. After around three hours of play I had to replace the batteries. I admit that I was using cheap batteries but even the best batteries wouldn't last that much longer I assume. I tested the batteries after it wouldn't use them and they were 3/4 full! I tried using some rechargables that I have but they only hold a 75% charge now so they never even played a song. So less then a week later I returned it for a full refund. After a couple of days and a little more research I just bought a Sony D-EJ611  G-Protection. I ended up spending twice as much money as I planned on but I finally have a portable cd player.

The controls are very easy on the tapes, with a smooth shut off when it gets to the end or when rewinding. It doesn't sound like it's trying to pull the tape apart the way some recorders used to do back in the day. So far no harm to any tapes. I've run about 30 to 40 tapes through it with no issues.

Not only was the connection rock solid, but the sound quality was excellent for vocal tracks and song services.  I was able to run the outputs to a soundboard and record the mix to digital with minimal noise and with no audio dropouts.  I eventually purchased a total of 8 of this model to record multiple services at once to a hard drive for archiving.  At less than $50 each, these units performed as well in this application as the much more expensive full-size component decks that they replaced, and saved a substantial amount of space in the studio as well.

This is the only reason for 4 and 5 stars, and I honestly feel bad for lowering the rating, because the optics (if not the mechanics) are outstanding. This was my first pair of binoculars: I got them for birding without doing too much research. They came up at the top when I searched ""best binoculars for birding"" and the price ($28.76) was easy to swallow even if they turned out to be a dud. I was so impressed with the picture quality (the seller uses ""HD clarity"" in the description and that seems spot on) that I became really curious if all binoculars are similar. I immediately bought a cheap pair of Vivitars with greater magnification and size (12x50 vs these being 7x35) and they turned out to be complete crap compared to these.

The binoculars were broken a month after we bought them and used 4 times for bird watching. They were never dropped nor had any damage dealt to them and we always stored them in the case. After minot usage, the quick focus mechanism became loose and the plastic sliding part of the mechanism started moving unevenly (see attached pictures), causing all images to be out of focus on one lens. Absolute poor craftsmanship and not something I would expect from the Bushnell brand. Please be aware that the product seems to be covered under warranty, however you are forced to pay shipping costs both ways, which equals to about half the price of the binoculars themselves (~$20). I wanted to love these binoculars and the quick focus mechanism seemed neat when it worked, but being forced to throw the product into the trash a month after purchase has to speak for itself"

One or the other would bind, cocking over to one side or the other, so that I'd need to manually (gently) pull on it. Turns out there's a pinch screw meant to hold the two eyepieces in alignment with each other, and that screw is behind the little metal circle stamped B on the focuser. You can't get to that screw to tighten it, so these are essentially disposable once that failure develops. See the attached photos: a gap will develop between the two eyepiece brackets and will widen with use. Better binoculars would have a way to retighten them, binding them together. Not these.

There's a quick solution to that- tighten the screw, but you can't access the screw on this set!

The bad news is you're not saving money, you're wasting it.  Don't buy this if you need shock protection - the ""40 second skip protection"" simply doesn't work, it jumps all over the place, because  after one shock the alleged ""shock protection"" needs to build  back up before it can take another mild bump.  Okay, fair enough, maybe you  wouldn't expect it to be too effective on a unit costing so little, but on  mine even the buttons don't work properly.  Press a button and it's pretty  much a lottery what will happen.  Press play and it might play, it might  not, or it might just play one track in repeat mode.  Press stop and it  might stop, but it probably wont, press stop three times and it might.  Press track skip or scan and you're opening a whole can of worms -  virtually anything could result, except of course the one thing you want to  happen.

Very simple VCR indeed, but with high technology features: 19 microns heads (improves video signal/noise ratio = better picture quality, especially on over-used rental tapes), improved high speed mechanic... Dont be fooled: all the entry level VCR share the same kind of noisy mechanic. The sound is very good (hifi mode), and acceptable in linear mono. If connected to cable TV, the setup is automatic (plug and play?).  Anyways, for a slowly disapearing format (VHS), why spend more money? The recording quality is fairly good and crisp.  Interesting point: Samsung is using the same basis for all it's VCR, probably for a better price management. That means that this entry level and the high end model differs only for features (front A/V inputs on the next model, and 'diamond' heads on the high end model)."

The lid is a fraction wobbly (It doesn't feel  like it will fall off, but I'd expect a more precise fit from Sony) but  closes with a very satisfying ""click"" sound. It has a nice satiny  metallic silver finish, that unfortunately is subseptable to scratching.  Scratches can be avoided by keeping the player in the nice charcoal-colored  carrying case it comes with. This case has an adjustable hand strap, and  openings for the display, the power input and headphone jacks. While in the  case it's impossible to change CDs and very difficult to adjust the volume  or engage/disengage the Hold feature. The headphone jack has an extra port  in order to accomodate (Sony) headphones with an inline remote, that oddly  are not availible with this model (I tried  calling Sony to no avail.  Hopefully these headphones will be availible in the future). The  accompanying headphones are of standard quality and don't handle bass at  high volumes well (they sound great at middle volumes); you'll want to get  a new pair ASAP (the matching Street Style ones, for example). The display  glows turquoise when the player is plugged in with the car or standard  adapter. This feature can't be turned on or off and does not operate with  batteries. The G-Protection is excellent and works extremely well (assuming  the CD playing is clean and not too scratched); keep in mind, however, that  if you jostle the player continuously, while it won't skip it will drain  your batteries faster. The bass boost is great and actually enhances all  frequencies, not just the low ones. The only real complaint I have about  the player is the placement of the controls; while asthetically pleasing  they are not in the most ergonomic places. Ideally you should be able to,  say, hold it in your right hand and operate it with your right thumb.  Instead you have to hold it in one hand and operate it with the other. This  may not seem like a big deal, but if your other hand is carrying shopping  bags, or whatever, this becomes annoying. Also, if you are looking to use  the player as your car's CD player often, note that the volume controls and  Open switch might be hard to use while driving. Other than that it's a  great player and I highly recommend it."

This is the second Discman that I've had (my first one - which was one of the older Sony Discmen - broke). Compared to my old one, this one is so much better! My first Discman said it was an anti-skip Discman, but it actually skipped everytime I put it down or picked it up. It was way too big and didn't provide all the nice features this new one has. Of course, I think the new Sony Discmen that have AM/FM Radios are much better than this - one of my friends has that kind - but this one is almost as good."

The best feature is the anti skip technology.  I  take it when I rollerblade or in the car and it hasn't skipped once!  Truly  amazing.  The case it comes with makes it very easy to hold in your hand as  you walk, run or blade, and leaves all the controls available at the same  time.  The only thing is you have to completely take the player out to  change a disc.  The design is really sleak and streamlined.  The player is  barely larger in circumfrence than a CD and it's very light too.  Another  great feature is the audio out jack.  With this you can connect it to a  tape or MD recorder and make your own recordings!  Big plus!"

This is my first Sony product. I  now have it for two weeks and still working strong. I've give it three  stars because some Sony parts are falling into pieces. Cons:The cover lid  is loose and couldn't be seal tightly, sound isn't loud enough all the way  to max volume, sometimes my battery indicator quited working, when I insert  a new cd sometimes it doesn't started in track one, the headphone is in a  poor balancing position, sometimes the cd spinner makes a loud knocking  sound while you inserted a new cd, and the battery cover lid couldn't be  closed tightly.Pros:Great battery life, bass and treble gives excellent  sound quality, superior G-Protection performance, sounds coming out from  the headphone is superb.Those who looking for a reliable and solid portable  cd player, I suggest you not to get a Sony, RCA, GPX, GE, AudioPhase, Koss,  and Aiwa (Aiwa is made by Sony)."

It has a very sleek, cool style. It is fairly thin and light though it doesn't feel very sturdy as  the top wiggles a bit.  I was a bit surprised by this but it works fine and  it hasn't caused a problem.  I really like the CD/tape adapter for the car  and the cigarrette lighter adapter.  They work great and are really useful.  I also really liked the backlit display which makes it really easy to see  no matter what the outer lighting.  It shows how much battery life you have  left and I was astounded that it only took two batteries and that the  lasted for up to 32 hours! It also comes with an AC adapter so you dont  even have to use the batteries.  The headphones that come with it are very  basic and i do not like them but they are really about the same as any  other you would get with a cd player.  The last thing it comes with is the  leather case.  I do not particularly like it because it makes it hard to  operate and does not fit very well.  You also cant remove cds with it on  but it is useful if you are planning on carrying it while walking or  something.  Overall, this is a very impressive cd player for what averages  out to be a great price.  Then throw in Sony's quality and reliability and  youve got a perfect cd player!  Easy listening!"

Althought a bit pricey, it is well worth the cost.  If comes with a number of accecories.  One, which is great is the CD converter.  All you do is put a tape which is  given to you in a tape player and hook the tape up to the CD player with  the cord.  Now, you can listen to music if your car does not have a CD  player.  Two other items are the cigarette lighter adapter and of course  the AC adapter.  It also come with a nice black leater carrying case which  is great.  It could fit a little better around the CD player but it is  still good.  It has a 32 hour battery life on 2 AA batteries.  It can  charge re-chargeable batteries with its AC adapter or car adapter.  It  almost never skips.  There may be a rare occasion that it does.  If you hit  stop you can return to the exact second of the song you were on just by  hitting play.  A great feature.  It has a hold switch so you don't  accidently skip over to the next track.  It is very light and very  portable.  It comes with a total of  three bass levels.  On the backlit  display, you can view the life of your batteries.  However, the display is  only backlit if it connected to another power source other than batteries.  It has great quality sound and 30 levels of loudness.  The headphones are  good.  There is also program up to 64 songs.  Out of all CD player's that I  have tried and looked at, going from one hour battery life on four AA's to  this, you should certanly get this one.  Well worth its cost, if you want  to get a CD player, this is one that you shouldn't pass up!"

And with the supplied leatherlike (its not leather, but its good enough), small drops won't harm it. Obviously is you viciously throw it up against a wall, 1/8 inch of leatherette won't do anything.

In fairness to the product, I did treat it a bit rough- hiking, camping, ect. Here's the deal, this model has a wheel for volume control instead of buttons. At some point I either set my bag down too hard or just packed everything too tight and both the volume wheel and the headphone jack sort of collapsed into the unit. It still works but the sound quality is VERY poor and of course the volume stays at one level only.  Just a warning to people who treat thier stuff like I do! Some good points: Before it broke the thing sounded great (not with the original headphones of course), it NEVER skipped, it is very small and light, and the battery life is very long- around 30 hours."

It's not just an excellent worldwide VCR, but it also plays video images in such a crisp and clear quality, much better than my standard VCR's.  When I play a video from Germany the quality is exactly the same as when I play a video from the US or from any other country.  However, we did have a little trouble trying to set it up.  Since it's a worldwide VCR there was no TV channel that I could set it to ( 3 or 4). So the worldwide VCR had to have extra cable wires hooked up to my TV for it to work.  And then my second VCR had to be set to the channel Line.  It was also a huge inconvenience to call Samsung Technical Support, it took me two days to get someone to help.  There is another item with the VCR that I noticed, when a program has to be tracked it will automatically track it.  But for some reason the color goes black & white (for about a split second).

The reviews for this model sounded good - and I have another model from Linksys that works fine - so I took the bait. Bad decision! If I'd read the review dates more carefully, I'd have noticed that most of them were many years old, going back to 2001 or earlier! This I failed to do, however (my bad, I know)."

It seems great when you set it up, but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection VERY frequently.  If you have an always on broadband connection, don't get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the Internet.  It's certainly the cheapest thing out there; spend more and get something else!  Furthermore, Linksys tech support is non-existent; they do not respond.  I had decided to return this, only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now I am stuck with it.  I will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash.  By the way, the next model up (BEFSR14-4port) has the same problem (from what I have read of other reviews).  If you still want to take a chance, just save the box and the receipt!"

Boy, did I ever!  It literally took about 5 minutes for me to get up and running. Of course, I already had a router set up, so it took plugging in two cables and two reboots of my main WinME machine (one with static IP to configure the router, one with DHCP back on).  I configured the box then waited with bated breath when I clicked the ""Connect"" button, but voila! we were on the web.  The web interface is both easy and extremely flexible, with a ton of advanced configuration options, including the DMZ option.  Of special interest to me is that my outbound socket woes have vanished -- the D-Link would not let me send e-mails or ftp puts greater than 2K or so, which was a real pain.  The Linksys didn't even hesitate.  Highly, highly recommend this product!!"

The auto-reverse is  also another great thing about it.  You can listen to a tape over and over  without ever having to open the cassette holder, which snaps the tape into  place so you never have to worry about it falling out.  The anti-rolling  mechanism allows you to move around without having the tape sound  distorted.  The metal tape ability also allows you to use several different  types of tapes whenever you want to.  Another useful thing, compared to  other Sony Walkmans, was the fact that this time the belt clip is ON the  Walkman and not on some leather cover case.  This one doesn't come with a  cover case, but then again it doesn't to since it's water proof.  30 preset  stations is about 15 more than most Walkmans come with, which are very easy  to set.  Mega-Bass allows hard blowing sounds provided you have a good  headphone system.  About the only thing I found a flaw in was the headphone  system it came with.  Very uncomfortable to handle, and I quickly got some  other earphones.  It even has a unique little system where you pull out a  rubber stub in the walkman to let out air pressure in case you ever travel  to higher altitudes!  And to top it off, besides having a belt clip, it  even comes with a wrist strap in case you don't want to use the belt clip  and would rather decide to have it strapped on your arm or hand.  As  you can see, a lot of good things came with this Walkman.  In case you ever  decide to move up to the more expensive Walkmans like I did, this one is a  good place to start off with.  I highly recommend it."

After exhausting other possibilities, the tech reps concluded that both routers are defective and I am returning them. (I bought the routers from a local retailer rather than Amazon.) Nearly as frustrating as the product defects was the company's lack of support for Macintosh.  Although the router is capable of operating in a Mac Ethernet network, the setup instructions, both in the documentation and on the company's web site, have critical gaps for Mac users.  To its credit, the company has 24-hour tech support. The tech reps are helpful but are not knowledgable about Macintosh.

We were about to go on a long road trip and I wanted to listen to my music without worrying about storing a hundred CD's to keep up with my family's diverse musical interests.  MP3s are the way to go, I fit 167 songs on one disc, plugged the Expanium into the cigarette lighter, popped the cassette adapter into the stereo, and we were off!  We never had to listen to the same song twice in what ended up being around 32 hours of time in the car!!  It never, ever skipped -- I even tested this by banging it around, tossing it in the air, etc. just to try and get it to skip, but it never did.  Who cares if it's square.  I didn't buy it to look at, I wanted to press play and forget about it. And that's exactly what I did with it. It's small enough that it can be stuffed into a little cranny in the car where it's out of the way but still keeps the music coming.  What a perfect gem this is.  With the resume feature, you can turn off the car and come back and hit play, and boom, there's the same song playing that you left it on when you got out of the car.  It's got excellent sound through ANY car speakers.  I can't recommend this enough!!!  Got a road trip on your planner?  Don't pass this up, don't consider anything else!!!"
10102,B00004UE2R,R3O6F6MQ22729H,This unit rocks,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2000",10 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This is a great MP3-CD Player.  In term of sound quality, it is good.  When I listen to my MP3s, I notice that piano and guitar harmonics sounds are kind of distorted.  Even though I can't tell if it is MP3's encoding problem or the unit's decoding problem, I will say it is MP3's encoding problem because of the way encoders work.  Just remember one thing: MP3 player consist of at least 2 important pieces: MP3 decoder which transform MP3 bytestream into waveform, and the D/A convertor which transform waveform into analog signal that we can hear.  The MP3 decoder is pretty much 'standard', but the D/A convertor is not.  That's where you should look at in term of playback quality, and it is also why I won't buy a shady-brand alternative.  Unit does not support ID tags, but it is not a problem to me since I just put inside a drawer in my car.  One bad thing in my set up is that I can't do song searching etc. while driving, but perhaps a remote like a standard CD-Player one would help... which is lacking here.  I think the MP3 organization on CD can be done with this way (and that's what I do) -- write a README.TXT in each dir that tells you what the heck is in the dir.  Name your sub-dir and songs like ALBUM000, 01.mp3 etc. and it should be fine."

(I used a MP3 disc...not sure how it does on CD's).  Now I know this player lacks a couple of features, such as Id3 tags, and a backlit screen....big deal/so what?

I broke down to call tech support and was scared to death after some of the things I read in here. It did take longer than the 30 minute time they projected (a lot more). When I did get someone on, he was great. He walked me through everything. One thing I really appreciated, he did not ask me to check connections etc, he listened to what info I could offer and started from there. In maybe 10 minutes he had me going again. The only reason I dont give this a five (which it probably deserves) is because I tried to follow the directions step by step unfortunately, they aren't crystal clear....but close enough.

I can't speak for the sound relative to others, but for voice, it's more than good enough. It picks up voices quite distinctly even in a relatively noisy environment. I also like the battery indicator, so I always know when I need to bring extra batteries, which last a pretty long time. I also can't speak for reliability, but I've had no problems in the six months I've been using it. The only caveats are that the microphone/earphone jack is smaller than ones used by other recorders, so you need an adapter or a mike/earphone with small plugs, and that it doesn't come with an AC power supply.

The Nomad, on the other hand, shows just how cool MP3 can be.

It's been a love-hate relationship.  The battery life is abysmal--the first unit I got from Amazon wouldn't hold a charge long enough to boot the machine up, and the one that Amazon sent to replace it is only marginally better.  Think of the Nomad as only quasi-portable, because battery life really sucks; the problem is compounded by the unit's boot-time battery life check.  It will often fail this test when there is plenty of juice in the box. The supplied PlayCenter software stuttered and faltered on Windows 2000, making it tricky to download more than a few files at a time.  And the Creative website was amazingly little help--they seem to have no clue on making PlayCenter useful to people.  The UI of the player itself is quirky and gets sluggish when you start to fill up the hard disk, but I can't really complain about it."

I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording & editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 & Nomad II are great for day use & jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner & carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home."

This is a quirky little device.  Doesn't have much competition in the router world except for it's big brothers, the RV082 and RV016 (which I highly recommend, btw).  Anyway, it seems to work wonderfully until I try to change the port for remote administration.  I use one in the high range (above 50000), which some TCP/IP guru would probably say is wrong.  Anyway, any other router that allows me to put in my own custom port value has worked fine, but changing the RA port on this one makes it not work, has to be reset to defaults and then reprogrammed.  Still, if you just leave that alone the rest of the features seem to work fine.  At 1/3 the price, it certainly is more affordable than the RV082.  The one place I use these is an office building where 5 non-profits all share office space and a tiny communications closet stuffed with wires.  This cuts the number of devices in half by combining the router and a big-enough switch into one unit.  Also, it's easy on their budgets.  The new models come with the nice small power brick that seems to use less power and generate less heat.  If you need performance/reliability and can afford it, get the RV082 instead.  If you're trying to fit a one-piece solution into a home structured-wiring cabinet, then this is a better choice because of less heat output and smaller footprint."

I ordered another one, confident it was a good product. Big mistake. Just from looking at it you can tell it has been downgraded  - 1 activity light per port where there used to be 3. It is unable to maintain a consistent connection with my Time-Warner cable modem. I've had the cable modem swapped out twice and tried three different routers, and all had the same problem; random disconnects and reconnects varying from at least one a day to several an hour. In desperation I hooked up the old one, and it's running fine on its remaining ports."

It tries so hard to be convenient it ends up being a nuisance.  Playlists are hard to make, because the software groups your songs by different categories that often times don't make sense.  I end up making my playlist in winamp and then exporting it to the musicmatch software and then downloading it to my player.  Also, the included software apparently is just the baseline software, and everytime you close it down, a very annoying pop-up screen appears asking you for money in order to upgrade to Musicmatch gold.  Bad form RCA, should have found better software to compliment your product."

The player itself is pretty small, but very convenient to carry around (you'll get to hook it onto your belt, hang it around your neck, or even wear it like a watch!) With only 64 mb (it's expandable), I can say you can store almost an hour worth of music in it, which doesn't seem like much, but that's what you get for a basic mp3 player.  The price is remarkable; I can't find a cheaper price elsewhere, plus the shipping is pretty fast too.  The only problem I have with this player is that it drains batteries fast.  Even though it says its life is 10 hrs, I really doubt it.  If you plan to get this, get rechargable batteries, that way you don't spend a lot on batteries."

When my cd player, which is relatively new, started malfuntioning, I decided to upgrade to an MP3 player.  I found a lot that were either out of my price range or had way more bells and whistles than I needed.  This player was what I needed at the right price.  When I got it home, I was a bit put out to discover that I had to load MusicMatch in order to use it, and that it doesn't work with Windows Media Player or Real Player, and it doesn't simply function as an external hard drive.  But MediaMatch is easy enough to use once loaded.  I recommend going for the 64MB memory model, since the price difference is 20 bucks.  I can get just over and hour of music on it, and I plan to invest in an external memory card later to expand the amount of music I can put on it.  What's more, I can decide from what day to the next which songs I want to carry around.  The neckband is great for the gym, as is the armband.  I'm hoping that if the plastic carrier breaks another one can be purchased easily.  For the money, and for what it does, this MP3 player is a good buy."

The software was easy to understand, and downloading was a breeze.  I could fit 130 minutes of cda files on the device.  You could fit infinitely more if you load MP3 files.  64 meg goes a long way.  The sound from the supplied headphones is awesome.  I wasn't expecting them to have such great bass.  Most of all, I love how small it is.  I'm a woman and I like to put it in my pants pocket and walk around the office with it.  No one knows I'm carrying it except they see the headphones.  I now wear a set of ear buds and hide the cord under a jacket or sweater to be more discreet.  The only drawback is you need the MMC card to expand the memory.  Its slot is too thin for an SD card which is more readily available.  That's the reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it."

Second, the piece of plastic that needs to be flipped-up in order to exchange the batteries, was ready to break the first time I tried opening it. Third, the volume control is an absolutely ridiculous push-up-and-down mechanism that has a loud pre-set as its lowest sound, whereas a dial control - from inaudible to loudest - would have been a much better choice.

The whole thing was Particle-Board so don’t let it fool  you into thinking you bought a quality piece of furniture it’s not.  All the hardware was probably the cheapest I have ever seen, especially trying to hold the large boards together while assembling.  It took forever to assemble not because I didn’t know what I was doing; it was because the hardware would keep falling apart while trying to get the operation done.  The instructions were pretty clear so that wasn’t a problem, getting the unsteady thing to stay together long enough to assemble the last pieces together was the problem.  The last couple of boards are what is holding it together, I mean keep it from falling apart. The hardware is so cheap the thing will never be sturdy, especially when it weighs 110 lbs.  The hardware must have been purchased in China at the discount store.  It is absolutely the most unsteady piece of furniture I have ever purchased."

The problem this creates is that back rod bends. So, you are forced to use legal size hanging files for letter sized folders if you want the support on both sides. Also, tried to store office supplies in the bottom drawer of of one of them and the bottom of the drawer bowed out. So you can't put much weight in them that way either. We are a 1 attorney office with 2 girls working, so not a large company."

The file cabinet is in the background and surrounded by the older Sauder bookcases."
10240,B00006IBAX,R3GXR01WDGOSU5,The item was poor quality,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"This item is massed produced and overtime the settings on various machine steps varied.  Just enough at each stage to make it difficult to get a secure connection.  The one cabinet was received damaged and had shipping labels to two other  buyers who had returned it.  The Company replaced the damaged items, with out hesitation and were pleasant to work with.  Came away with the feeling this was standard procedure."
10241,B00006IBAX,R1SJTJRC24EL2P,"Would have been nicer if parts weren’t broken, not labeled and missing.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"I have bought many Sudafed products and know what to to expect. I know it isn’t wood and it is for mass production, but normally it is easy to put together and comes together looking nice. Unfortunately, there were a few pieces that were broken which means it won’t be as stable and part of the “finished” section was broke like others have shown. Assembly was normal but I had to either leave it in a pile while the comma y shipped me replacement parts or do the best I could. I would have returned it for a replacement but I needed it for work immediately and didn’t want to wait."
10242,B00006IBAX,R1W3J56N71Q2QV,Beautiful and functional; few assembly blips,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018",One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Looks very nice, works great. The only downside is the assembly, and not a huge issue. For one thing, only 1 of the 17 boards are labeled - huh? All I got was an E3 on 1 board, nothing else. If you stare very close at the pictures, in about 10 minutes you can figure out by the arrangements of the predrilled holes which is which, but how hard would it have been to label them at the factory. I only goofed at 1 step - rather confusing which way a board went - but it was obvious after screwing them together that it was backwards. Also, the way 1 Step ended, you would crack the board if you didn't support the connected piece at the same time with the board from the next step - again, if you've done this before, fairly obvious. Hardware WAS well labeled. They should have included a 30 cent wrench which is needed for the lock assembly, or told you one was needed, but again, minor quibbles."
